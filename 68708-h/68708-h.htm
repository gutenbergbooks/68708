<h2 class="nobreak fs135" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">THE title of this book may perhaps be considered by
some as too ambitious, and may provoke comparison
with others somewhat similar in name, but with whose
distinguished authors I have no claim at all to compete.</p>

<p>I have no tales to tell of hair-breadth escapes from savage
beasts, no shooting of “big game,” no stalking of elephant or
rhinoceros, of “hippo” or giraffe. We have indeed no big
game in Madagascar. The most dangerous sport in its woods
is hunting the wild boar; the largest carnivore to be met with
is the fierce little <em>fòsa</em>, and the crocodile is the most dangerous
reptile.</p>

<p>But I ask the courteous reader to wander with me into the
wonderful and mysterious forests, and to observe the gentle
lemurs in their home, as they leap from tree to tree, or take
refuge in the thickets of bamboo; to come out in the dusk and
watch the aye-aye as he stealthily glides along the branches,
obtaining his insect food under the bark of the trees; to listen
to the song of numerous birds, and to note their habits and
curious ways; to hear the legends and folk-tales in which the
Malagasy have preserved the wisdom of their ancestors with
regard to the feathered denizens of the woods and plains, and
to admire the luxuriant vegetation of the forests, and the trees
and plants, the ferns and flowers, and even the grasses, which
are to be found in every part of the island.</p>

<p>I invite those who may read these pages to look with me at
the little rodents and insect-eaters which abound in and near
the woods; to mark the changing chameleons which are found
here in such variety; to watch the insects which gambol in the
sunshine, or hide in the long grass, or sport on the streams. If
such unexciting pleasures as these can interest my readers, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
can promise that there is in Madagascar enough and to spare
to delight the eye and to charm the imagination.</p>

<p>I confess that I am one of those who take much more delight
in silently watching the birds and their pretty ways in some
quiet nook in the woods, than in shooting them to add a specimen
to a museum; and that I feel somewhat of a pang in catching
even a butterfly, and would much rather observe its lovely
colours in life, as it unfolds them to the sunshine, than study it
impaled on a pin in a cabinet. No doubt collections are
necessary, but I have never cared to make them myself.</p>

<p>Nothing is here recorded but facts which have come under
my own observation or as related by friends and others whose
authority is unquestionable. And while my main object is to
convey a vivid and true impression of the animal and vegetable
life of Madagascar, I have also given many sketches of what is
curious and interesting in the habits and customs of the Malagasy
people, among whom I have travelled repeatedly, and
with whom I have lived for many years. I have no pretensions
to be a scientific naturalist or botanist, I have only been a careful
observer of the beautiful and wonderful things that I have seen
and I have constantly noted down what many others have
observed, and have here included information which they have
given in the following pages.</p>

<p>I have long wished that someone far more competent than
myself would write a popular book upon the natural history
and botany of this great island; but as I have not yet heard
of any such, I venture with some diffidence to add this book
to the large amount of literature already existing about Madagascar,
but none of it exactly filling this place. For many
years I edited, together with my late friend and colleague,
the Rev. R. Baron, the numbers of <cite>The Antanànarìvo Annual</cite>,
a publication which was “a record of information on the topography
and natural productions of Madagascar, and the customs,
traditions, language and religious beliefs of its people,”
and for which I was always on the look-out for facts of all kinds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
bearing on the above-mentioned subjects. But as this magazine
was not known to the general public, and was confined to
a very limited circle of readers, I have not hesitated to draw
freely on the contents of its twenty-four numbers, as I am
confident that a great deal of the information there contained
is worthy of a much wider circulation than it had in the pages
of the <cite>Annual</cite>.</p>

<p>Finally, as preachers say, although this book is written by
a missionary, it is not “a missionary book”; not, certainly,
because I undervalue missionary work, in which, after nearly
fifty years’ acquaintance with it, and taking an active part in it,
I believe with all my heart and soul, but because that aspect
of Madagascar has already been so fully treated. Books
written by the Revs. W. Ellis, Dr Mullens, Mr Prout, Dr
Matthews, Mr Houlder, myself and others, give all that is necessary
to understand the wonderful history of Christianity in this
island. Despite what globe-trotting critics may say, as well as
colonists who seem to consider that all coloured peoples may
be exploited for their own benefit, mission work, apart from its
simply obeying the last commands of our Lord, is <em>the</em> great
civilising, educational and benevolent influence in the world,
deny it who can! But in this book I want to show that
Madagascar is full of interest in other directions, and that the
wonderful things that live and grow here are hardly less worthy
of study than those events which have attracted the attention of
Christian and benevolent people for nearly a hundred years past.</p>

<p>The author thanks very sincerely his friends, Mr John
Parrett, Monsieur Henri Noyer, and Razaka, for their freely
accorded permission to reproduce many photographs taken by
them and used to illustrate this book. And his grateful thanks
are also due to his old friend, the Rev. J. Peill, for the care
he has taken in going through the proof sheets, especially in
seeing that all Madagascar words are correctly given.</p>

<p>Two or three chapters of this book cover, to some extent,
the same ground as those treated of in another book on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Madagascar by the author, published some years ago by
Mr Fisher Unwin. The author here acknowledges, with
many thanks, Mr Fisher Unwin’s kindness in giving full
permission to produce these, which are, however, rewritten
and largely added to.</p>

<div class="p4 fs90">

<em>NOTE.</em>—Throughout this book Malagasy words are accented on
the syllables which should be emphasised, and if it is borne in
mind that the vowels <em>a</em>, <em>e</em> and <em>i</em> have as nearly as possible the same
sound as in French or Italian, and that <em>o</em> is exactly like our English
<em>o</em> in <em>do</em>, <em>to</em> and <em>move</em>, and that the consonants do not differ much in
sound from those in English, except that <em>g</em> is always hard, <em>s</em> always
a sibilant and not like <em>z</em>, and <em>j</em> is like <em>dj</em> there will be no difficulty
in pronouncing Malagasy words with a fair amount of accuracy.

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<br />
<span class="fs70">INTRODUCTORY</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">THE great African island of Madagascar has become
well known to Europeans during the last half-century,
and especially since the year 1895, when it was made
a colony of France. During that fifty years many books—the
majority of these in the French language—have been written
about the island and its people; what was formerly an almost
unknown country has been traversed by Europeans in all
directions; its physical geography is now clearly understood;
since the French occupation it has been scientifically surveyed,
and a considerable part of the interior has been laid down with
almost as much detail as an English ordnance map. But although
very much information has been collected with regard
to the country, the people, the geology, and the animal and
vegetable productions of Madagascar, there has hitherto been
no attempt, at least in the English language, to collect these
many scattered notices of the Malagasy fauna and flora, and
to present them to the public in a readable form.</p>

<p>In several volumes of a monumental work that has been in
progress for many years past, written and edited by M. Alfred
Grandidier,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the natural history and the botany of the island are
being exhaustively described in scientific fashion; but these
great quartos are in the French language, while their costly
character renders them unknown books to the general reader.
It is the object of the following pages to describe, in as familiar
and popular a fashion as may be, many of the most interesting
facts connected with the exceptional animal life of Madagascar,
and with its forestal and other vegetable productions. During<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
nearly fifty years’ connection with this country the writer has
travelled over it in many directions, and while his chief time
and energies have of course been given to missionary effort, he
has always taken a deep interest in the living creatures which
inhabit the island, as well as in its luxuriant flora, and has
always been collecting information about them. The facts
thus obtained are embodied in the following pages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROADS AND TRAVELLING</div>

<p>It is probably well known to most readers of this book that
a railway now connects Tamatave, the chief port of the east
coast, with Antanànarìvo, the capital, which is about a third of
the way across the island. So that the journey from the coast
to the interior, which, up to the year 1899, used to take from
eight to ten days, can now be accomplished in one day. Besides
this, good roads now traverse the country in several
directions, so that wheeled vehicles can be used; and on some
of these a service of motor cars keeps up regular communication
with many of the chief towns and the capital.</p>

<p>But we shall not, in these pages, have much to do with these
modern innovations, for a railway in Madagascar is very much
like a railway in Europe. Our journeys will mostly be taken
by the old-fashioned native conveyance, the <em>filanjàna</em> or light
palanquin, carried by four stout and trusty native bearers.
We shall thus not be whirled through the most interesting portion
of our route, catching only a momentary glimpse of many a
beautiful scene. We can get down and walk, whenever we like,
to observe bird or beast or insect, to gather flower or fern or
lichen or moss, or to take a rock specimen, things utterly
impracticable either by railway or motor car, and not very easy
to do in any wheeled conveyance. Our object will be, not to
get through the journey as fast as possible, but to observe all
that is worth notice during the journey. We shall therefore,
in this style of travel, not stay in modern hotels, but in native
houses, notwithstanding their drawbacks and discomforts; and
thus we shall see the Malagasy as they are, and as their ancestors
have been for generations gone by, almost untouched by
European influence, and so be able to observe their manners
and customs, and learn something of their ideas, their superstitions,
their folk-lore, and the many other ways in which they
differ from ourselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXTENT OF THE ISLAND</div>

<p>Let us, however, first try to get a clear notion about this great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
island, and to realise how large a country it is. Take a fair-sized
map of Madagascar, and we see that it rises like some huge
sea-monster from the waters of the Indian Ocean; or, to use
another comparison, how its outline is very like the sole—the
left-hand one—of a human foot. As we usually look at the
island in connection with a map of Africa, it appears as a mere
appendage to the great “Dark Continent”; and it is difficult to
believe that it is really a thousand miles long, and more than
three hundred miles broad, with an area of two hundred and
thirty thousand square miles, thus exceeding that of France,
Belgium and Holland all put together.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Before the year 1871
all maps of Madagascar, as regards its interior, were pure guesswork.
A great backbone of mountains was shown, with
branches on either side, like a huge centipede. But it is now
clear that, instead of these fancy pictures, there is an extensive
elevated region occupying about two-thirds of the island to the
east and north, leaving a wide stretch of low country to the
west and south; and as the watershed is much nearer the east
than the west of the island, almost all the chief rivers flow,
not into the Indian Ocean, but into the Mozambique Channel.
When we add that a belt of dense forest runs all along the east
side of Madagascar, and is continued, with many breaks, along
the western side, and that scores of extinct volcanoes are found
in several districts of the interior, we shall have said all that is
necessary at present as to the physical geography. Many more
details of this, as well as of the geology, will come under our
notice as we travel through the country in various directions.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> I have often been astonished and amused by the notions

<span class="fs70">TAMATAVE AND FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THE COUNTRY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-capy">IT was on a bright morning in September, 1863, that I first
came in sight of Madagascar. In those days there was
no service of steamers, either of the “Castle” or the
“Messageries Maritimes” lines, touching at any Madagascar
port, and the passage from Mauritius had to be made in what
were termed “bullockers.” These vessels were small brigs or
schooners which had been condemned for ordinary traffic, but
were still considered good enough to convey from two to three
hundred oxen from Tamatave to Port Louis or Réunion. It
need hardly be said that the accommodation on board these
ships was of the roughest, and the food was of the least appetising
kind. A diet of cabbage, beans and pumpkin led one of
my friends to describe the menu of the bullocker as “the green,
the brown, and the yellow.” Happily, the voyage to Madagascar
was usually not very long, and in my case we had a quick
and pleasant passage of three days only; but I hardly hoped
that daylight on Wednesday morning would reveal the country
on which my thoughts had been centred for several weeks past;
so it was with a strange feeling of excitement that soon after
daybreak I heard the captain calling to me down the hatchway:
“We are in sight of land!” Not many minutes elapsed before
I was on deck and looking with eager eyes upon the island in
which eventually most of my life was to be spent. We were
about five miles from the shore, running under easy sail to the
northward, until the breeze from the sea should set in and enable
us to enter the harbour of Tamatave.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TAMATAVE AND FIRST IMPRESSIONS</div>

<p>There was no very striking feature in the scene—no towering
volcanic peaks, as at Mauritius and Aden, yet it was not
without beauty. A long line of blue mountains in the distance,
covered with clouds; a comparatively level plain extending
from the hills to the sea, green and fertile with cotton and sugar
and rice plantations; while the shore was fringed with the tall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
trunks and feathery crowns of the cocoanut-palms which rose
among the low houses of the village of Tamatave. These,
together with the coral reefs forming the harbour, over which
the great waves thundered and foamed—all formed a picture
thoroughly tropical, reminding me of views of islands in the
South Pacific.</p>

<p>The harbour of Tamatave is protected by a coral reef, which
has openings to the sea both north and south, the latter being
the principal entrance; it is somewhat difficult of access, and
the ribs and framework of wrecked vessels are (or perhaps
rather <em>were</em>) very frequently seen on the reef. The captain had
told me that sometimes many hours and even days were spent
in attempting to enter, and that it would probably be noon before
we should anchor. I therefore went below to prepare for landing,
but in less than an hour was startled to hear by the
thunder of the waves on the reef and the shouts of the seamen
reducing sail that we were already entering the harbour. The
wind had proved unexpectedly favourable, and in a few more
minutes the cable was rattling through the hawsehole, the
anchor was dropped, and we swung round at our moorings.</p>

<p>There were several vessels in the harbour. Close to us was
H.M.’s steamer <i>Gorgon</i>, and, farther away, two or three French
men-of-war, among them the <i>Hermione</i> frigate, bearing the flag
of Commodore Dupré, their naval commandant in the Indian
Ocean, as well as plenipotentiary for the French Government
in the disputes then pending concerning the Lambert Treaty.
I was relieved to find that everything seemed peaceful and
quiet at Tamatave, and that the long white flag bearing the
name of Queen Ràsohèrina, in scarlet letters, still floated from
the fort at the southern end of the town. I had been told at
Port Louis that things were very unsettled in Madagascar, and
that I should probably find Tamatave being bombarded by the
French; but it is unnecessary to refer further to what is now
ancient history, or to touch upon political matters, which lie
quite outside the main purpose of this book.</p>

<p>Tamatave, as a village, has not a very inviting appearance
from the sea, and man’s handiwork had certainly not added
much to the beauty of the landscape. Had it not been for the
luxuriant vegetation of the pandanus, palms, and other tropical
productions, nothing could have been less interesting than the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
native town, which possessed at that time few European residences
and no buildings erected for religious worship.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Canoes,
formed out of the trunk of a single tree, soon came off to our
ship, but I was glad to dispense with the services of these unsafe-looking
craft, and to accept a seat in the captain’s boat. Half-an-hour
after anchoring we were rowing towards the beach, and
in a few minutes I leaped upon the sand, with a thankful heart
that I had been permitted to tread the shores of Madagascar.</p>

<p>Proceeding up the main street—a sandy road bordered by
enclosures containing the stores of a few European traders—we
came to the house of the British Vice-Consul. Here I found
Mr Samuel Procter, who was subsequently the head for many
years of one of the chief trading houses in the island, and also
Mr F. Plant, a gentleman employed by the authorities of the
British Museum to collect specimens of natural history in the
then almost unknown country. From them I learned that a
missionary party which had preceded me from Mauritius had
left only two days previously for the capital, and that Mr Plant
had kindly undertaken to accompany me on the journey for the
greater part of the distance to Antanànarìvo. At first we
thought of setting off on that same evening, so as to overtake
our friends, but finding that this would involve much fatigue, we
finally decided to wait for two or three days and take more time
to prepare for the novel experiences of a Madagascar journey.
In a little while I was domiciled at Mr Procter’s store, where
I was hospitably entertained during my stay in Tamatave.</p>

<p>The afternoon of my first day on shore was occupied in seeing
after the landing of my baggage. This was no easy or pleasant
task; the long rolling swell from the ocean made the transfer
of large wooden cases from the vessel to the canoes a matter
requiring considerable dexterity. More than once I expected
to be swamped, and that through the rolling of the ship the
packages would be deposited at the bottom of the harbour.
It was therefore with great satisfaction that I saw all my
property landed safely on the beach.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BULLOCKER</div>

<p>Although Tamatave has always been the chief port on the
east coast of Madagascar, there were, for many years after my
arrival there, no facilities for landing or shipping goods. The
bullocks, which formed the staple export, were swum off to the
ships, tied by their horns to the sides of large canoes, and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
slung on board by tackles from the yard-arm. From the shouting
and cries of the native drovers, the struggles of the oxen,
and their starting back from the water, it was often a very
exciting scene. A number of these bullockers were always
passing between the eastern ports of Madagascar and the
islands of Mauritius and Réunion, and kept the markets of these
places supplied with beef at moderate rates. The vessels
generally ceased running for about four months in the early
part of the year, when hurricanes are prevalent in the Indian
Ocean; and it may easily be supposed that the passenger
accommodation on board these ships was not of the first order.
However, compared with the discomforts and, often, the danger
and long delays endured by some, I had not much to complain
of in my first voyage to Madagascar. It had, at least, the
negative merit of not lasting long, and I had not then the
presence of nearly three hundred oxen as fellow-passengers
for about a fortnight, as on my voyage homewards, when I had
also a severe attack of malarial fever.</p>

<p>The native houses of Tamatave, like those of the other coast
villages, were of very slight construction, being formed of a
framework of wood and bamboo, filled in with leaves of the
pandanus and the traveller’s tree. In a few of these some
attempts at neatness were observable, the walls being lined with
coarse cloth made of the fibre of <em>rofìa</em>-palm leaves, and the floor
covered with well-made mats of papyrus. But the general
aspect of the native quarter of the town was filthy and repulsive;
heaps of putrefying refuse exhaled odours which warned one to
get away as soon as possible. In almost every other house a
large rum-barrel, ready tapped, showed what an unrestricted
trade was doing to demoralise the people.</p>

<p>I could not help noticing the strange articles of food exposed
for sale in the little market of the Bétsimisàraka quarter. Great
heaps of brown locusts seemed anything but inviting, nor were
the numbers of minute fresh-water shrimps much more tempting
in appearance. With these, however, were plentiful supplies of
manioc root, rice of several kinds, potatoes and many other
vegetables, the brilliant scarlet pods of different spices, and
many varieties of fruit—pine-apples, bananas, melons, peaches,
citrons and oranges. Beef was cheap as well as good, and there
was a lean kind of mutton, but it was much like goat-flesh.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Great quantities of poultry are reared in the interior and are
brought down to the coast for sale to the ships trading at the
ports.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NATIVE HOUSES</div>

<p>The houses of the Malagasy officials and the principal foreign
traders were substantially built of wooden framework, with
walls and floors of planking and thatched with the large leaves
of the traveller’s tree. No stone can be procured near Tamatave,
nor can bricks be made there, as the soil is almost entirely sand;
the town itself is indeed built on a peninsula, a sand-bank thrown
up by the sea, under the shelter of the coral reefs which form the
harbour. The house where I was staying consisted of a single
long room, with the roof open to the ridge; a small sleeping
apartment was formed at one corner by a partition of <em>rofìa</em>
cloth. There was no window, but light and air were admitted
by large doors, which were always open during the day. A few
folds of Manchester cottons, to serve as mattress, and a roll of
the same for a pillow, laid on Mr Procter’s counter, formed a
luxurious bed after the discomforts of a bullock vessel. All
around us, in the native houses, singing and rude music, with
drumming and clapping of hands, were kept up far into the
night; and these sounds, as well as the regular beating of the
waves all round the harbour, and the excitement of the new and
strange scenes of the past day, kept me from sleep until the
small hours of the morning.</p>

<p>The following day I went to make a visit to the Governor of
Tamatave, as a new arrival in the country. My host accompanied
me, as I was of course quite unable to talk Malagasy.
As this was a visit of ceremony, it was not considered proper
to walk, so we went by the usual conveyance of the country,
the <em>filanjàna</em>. This word means anything by which articles or
persons are carried on the shoulder, and is usually translated
“palanquin,” but the <em>filanjàna</em> is a very different thing from
the little portable room which is used in India. In our case it
was a large easy-chair, attached to two poles, and carried by
four stout men, or <em>màromìta</em>, as they are called. They carried
us at a quick trot; but this novel experience struck me—I can
hardly now understand why—as irresistibly ludicrous, and I
could not restrain my laughter at the comical figure—as it then
seemed to me—that we presented, especially when I thought of
the sensation we should make in the streets of an English town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>The motion was not unpleasant, as the men keep step together.
Every few minutes they change the poles from one shoulder to
the other, lifting them over their heads without any slackening
of speed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GOVERNOR</div>

<p>A few minutes brought us to the fort, at the southern end of
the town; this was a circular structure of stone, with walls
about twenty feet high, which were pierced with openings for
about a dozen cannon. We had to wait for a few minutes until
the Governor was informed of our arrival, and thus had time to
think of the scene this fort presented not twenty years before
that time, when the heads of many English and French sailors
were fixed on poles around the fort. These ghastly objects were
relics of those who were killed in an attack made upon Tamatave
in 1845, by a combined English and French force, to redress some
grievances of the foreign traders. But we need not be too hard
on the Malagasy when we remember that, not a hundred years
before that time, we in England followed the same delectable
custom, and adorned Temple Bar and other places with the
heads of traitors.</p>

<p>Presently we were informed that the Governor was ready to
receive us. Passing through the low covered way cut through
the wall, we came into the open interior space of the fort. The
Governor’s house, a long low wooden structure, was opposite to
us; while, on the right, he was seated under the shade of a large
tree, with a number of his officers and attendants squatting
around him. They were mostly dressed in a mixture of European
and native costume—viz. a shirt and trousers, over which were
thrown the folds of the native <em>làmba</em>, an oblong piece of calico
or print, wrapped round the body, with one end thrown over
the left shoulder. Neat straw hats of native manufacture
completed their costume. The Governor, whose name was
Andrìamandròso, was dressed in English fashion, with black
silk “top hat” and worked-wool slippers. He had a very
European-looking face, dark olive complexion, and was an
<em>andrìana</em>—that is, one of a clan or tribe of the native nobility.
He did not speak English, but through Mr Procter we exchanged
a few compliments and inquiries. I assured him of the
interest the people of England took in Madagascar, and their
wish to see the country advancing. Presently wine was
brought, and after drinking to the Governor’s health we took our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
leave. The Hova government maintained, until the French
conquest, a garrison of from two to three hundred men at
Tamatave. These troops had their quarters close to the fort, in
a number of houses placed in rows and enclosed in a large square
or <em>ròva</em>, formed of strong wooden palisades, with gateways.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A ROUGH AND READY CANTEEN</div>

<p>The following day was occupied in making preparations for
the journey, purchasing a few of the most necessary articles of
crockery, etc., and unpacking my canteen. This latter was a
handsome teak box, and fitted up most neatly with plates,
dishes, knives and forks, etc. But Mr Plant said that both the
box and most of its contents were far too good to be exposed to
the rough usage they would undergo on the journey; so I took
out some of the things and repacked the box in its wooden case.
Subsequent experience showed the wisdom of this advice, and that
it was a mistake to use too expensive articles for such travelling
as that in Madagascar, or to have to spend much time in getting
out and putting in again everything in its proper corner. Upon
reaching the halting-place after a fatiguing journey of several
hours, it is a great convenience to get at one’s belongings with
the least possible amount of exertion; and when starting before
sunrise in the mornings, it is not less pleasant to be able to
dispense with an elaborate fitting of things into a canteen. By
my friend’s advice, I therefore bought a three-legged iron pot
for cooking fowls, some common plates, and a tin coffee-pot,
which also served as a teapot when divested of its percolator.
These things were stowed away in a mat bag, which proved the
most convenient form of canteen possible for such a journey
The contents were quickly put in, and as readily got out when
wanted; and, thus provided, we felt prepared to explore
Madagascar from north to south, quite independent of inns and
innkeepers, chambermaids and waiters, had such members of
society existed in this primitive country.</p>


<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> It is perhaps hardly necessary to say that for some years
past Tamatave has been a very different place from what is
described above. Many handsome buildings—offices, banks,
shops, hotels and government offices—have been erected; the
town is lighted at night by electricity; piers have been constructed;
and in the suburbs shady walks and roads are
bordered by comfortable villa residences and their luxuriant
gardens.</p>

<span class="fs70">FROM COAST TO CAPITAL: ALONG THE SEASHORE</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">TRAVELLING in Madagascar fifty years ago, and indeed
for many years after that date, differed considerably
from what we have any experience of in Europe. It
was not until the year 1901 that a railway was commenced from
the east coast to the interior, and it is only a few months ago
that direct communication by rail has been completed between
Tamatave and Antanànarìvo. But until the French occupation,
in 1895, a road, in our sense of the word, did not exist in the
island; and all kinds of merchandise brought from the coast
to the interior, or taken between other places, were carried for
great distances on men’s shoulders. There were but three
modes of conveyance—viz. one’s own legs, the <em>làkana</em> or canoe,
and the <em>filanjàna</em> or palanquin. We intended to make use of
all these means of getting over the ground (and water); but by
far the greater part of the journey of two hundred and twenty
miles would be performed in the <em>filanjàna</em>, carried on the sinewy
shoulders of our bearers or <em>màromìta</em>. This was <em>the</em> conveyance
of the country (and it is still used a good deal); for during the
first thirty years and more of my residence in Madagascar
there was not a single wheeled vehicle of any kind to be seen
in the interior, nor did even a wheelbarrow come under my
observation during that time.</p>

<p>This want of our European means of conveyance arose from
the fact that no wheeled vehicles could have been used owing to
the condition of the tracks then leading from one part of the
country to another. The lightest carriage or the strongest
waggon would have been equally impracticable in parts of the
forest where the path was almost lost in the dense undergrowth,
and where the trees barely left room for a palanquin to pass.
Nor could any team take a vehicle up and down some of the tremendous
gorges, by tracks which sometimes wind like a corkscrew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
amidst rocks and twisted roots of trees, sometimes climb
broad surfaces of slippery basalt, where a false step would send
bearers and palanquin together into steep ravines far below, and
again are lost in sloughs of adhesive clay, in which the bearers
at times sink to the waist, and when the traveller has to leap
from the back of one man to another to reach firm standing-ground.
Shaky bridges of primitive construction, often consisting
of but a single tree trunk, were frequently the only means
of crossing the streams; while more often they had to be forded,
one of the men going cautiously in advance to test the depth of
the water. It occasionally happened that this pioneer suddenly
disappeared, affording us and his companions a good deal of
merriment at his expense. At times I have had to cross rivers
when the water came up to the necks of the bearers, the shorter
men having to jump up to get breath, while they had to hold
the palanquin high up at arm’s-length to keep me out of the
water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GENERAL FOREST AND GENERAL FEVER</div>

<p>It was often asked: Why do not the native government improve
the roads? The neglect to do so was intentional on their
part, for it was evident to everyone who travelled along the
route from Tamatave to the capital that the track might have
been very much improved at a comparatively small expense.
The Malagasy shrewdly considered that the difficulty of the
route to the interior would be a formidable obstacle to an invasion
by a European power, and so they deliberately allowed
the path to remain as rugged as it is by nature. The first
Radàma is reported to have said, when told of the military genius
of foreign soldiers, that he had two officers in his service,
“General Hàzo,” and “General Tàzo” (that is, “Forest and
Fever”), whom he would match against any European commander.
Subsequent events so far justified his opinion that
the French invasion of the interior in 1895 did not follow the
east forest road, but the far easier route from the north-west
coast. The old road through the double belt of forests would
have presented formidable obstacles to the passage of disciplined
troops, and at many points it might have been
successfully contested by a small body of good marksmen,
well acquainted with the localities.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">PLEASURES AND DISCOMFORTS</div>

<p>It may be gathered from what has been already said that
travelling in Madagascar in the old times had not a little of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
adventure and novelty connected with it. Provided the weather
was moderately fine, there was enough of freshness and often
of amusing incident to render the journey not unenjoyable,
especially if travelling in a party; and even to a solitary
traveller there is such a variety of scenery, and so many and
beautiful forms of vegetation, to arrest the attention, that it
was by no means monotonous. Of course there must be a
capacity for “roughing it,” and for turning the very discomforts
into sources of amusement. We must not be too much
disturbed at a superabundance of fleas or mosquitoes in the
houses, nor be frightened out of sleep by the scampering of rats
around and occasionally even upon us. It sometimes happens,
too, that a centipede or a scorpion has to be dislodged from
under the mats upon which we are about to lay our mattresses,
but, after all, a moderate amount of caution will prevent us
taking much harm.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, however, that if the weather prove unfavourable
the discomforts are great, and it requires a resolute
effort to look at the bright side of things. To travel for several
hours in the rain, with the bearers slipping about in the stiff
adhesive clay—now sinking to the knees in a slough in the
hollows, and then painfully toiling up the rugged ascents—with
a chance of being benighted in the middle of the forest, were
not enjoyable incidents in the journey. Added to this, occasionally
the bearers of baggage and bedding and food would be
far behind, and sometimes would not turn up at all, leaving us
to go supperless, not to bed, but to do as well as we could on a
dirty mat. But, after all said and done, I can look back on
many journeys with great pleasure; and my wife and I have
even said to each other at the end, “It has been like a prolonged
picnic.” And by travelling at the proper time of the
year—for we never used, if possible, to take long journeys in
the rainy season—and with ordinary care in arranging the
different stages, there was often no more discomfort than that
inseparable from the unavoidable fatigue.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast on the morning of the 3rd October the
yard of Mr Procter’s house was filled with the bearers waiting to
take their packages, and, as more came than were actually required,
there was a good deal of noise and confusion until all
the loads had been apportioned. Most of my <em>màromìta</em> were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
strong and active young men, spare and lithe of limb, and proved
to possess great powers of endurance. The loads they carried
were not very heavy, but it was astonishing to see with what
steady patience they bore them hour after hour under a burning
sun, and up and down paths in the forest, where their progress
was often but a scrambling from one foothold to another. Two
men would take a load of between eighty and ninety pounds,
slung on a bamboo, between them; and this was the most
economical way of taking goods, for, on account of the difficulty
of the paths, four men found it more fatiguing to carry in one
package a weight which, divided into two, could easily be
borne by two sets of bearers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MY PALANQUIN</div>

<p>Eight of the strongest and most active young men, accustomed
to work together, were selected to carry my palanquin, and took
it in two sets of four each, carrying alternately. Most of the
articles of my baggage were carried by two men; but my two
large flat wooden cases, containing drawing boards, paper and
instruments, required four men each. All baggage was carried
by the same men throughout the journey, without any relay or
change, except shifting the pole from one shoulder to the other;
but my palanquin, as already said, had a double set. The
personal bearers, therefore, naturally travel quicker than those
carrying the baggage, and we generally arrived at the halting-places
an hour or more before the others came up. The hollow
of the bamboos to which boxes and cases were slung served for
carrying salt, spoons, and various little properties of the bearers,
and sometimes small articles of European make for selling at
the capital. The men were, and still are, very expert in packing
and securing goods committed to their charge. Prints, calicoes
and similar materials were often covered with pandanus leaves
and so made impervious to the wet; and even sugar and salt
were carried in the same way without damage.</p>

<p>As the conveyance of myself and my baggage required more
than thirty men, and Mr Plant took a dozen in addition, it was
some time before everything was arranged, and there was a good
deal of contention as to getting the lightest and most convenient
packages to carry. We had hoped to start early in the forenoon,
but it was after one o’clock when we sent off the last cases and
I stepped into my <em>filanjàna</em> to commence the novel experience
of a journey in Madagascar. We formed quite a large party as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
we set off from Tamatave and turned southwards into the open
country. The rear was brought up by a bearer of some intelligence
and experience, who only carried a spear, and was to act
as captain over the rest and look out accommodation for us in
the villages, etc. He had also to see after the whole of the
luggage, and take care that everyone had his proper load and
came up to time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FILANJÀNA</div>

<p>My <em>filanjàna</em> was a different kind of thing from the chair in
which I had gone to visit the Governor. It was of the same
description as that commonly used by Malagasy ladies—made
of an oblong framework of light wood, filled in with a plaited
material formed of strips of sheepskin, and carried on poles,
which were the midrib of the enormous leaves of the <em>rofìa</em>-palm.
In this I sat, legs stretched out at full length, a piece of board
fixed as a rest for the back, and the whole made fairly comfortable
by means of cushions and rugs. There was plenty of space
for extra wraps, waterproof coat, telescope, books, etc. When
ladies travel any distance in this kind of <em>filanjàna</em> a hood of <em>rofìa</em>
cloth is fixed so as to draw over the head and to protect them
from the sun and rain. In my case, a stout umbrella served
instead, and a piece of waterproof cloth protected me fairly well
from the little rain that fell on the journey. (I may add here
that this was the first, and the last, journey I ever took in this
kind of <em>filanjàna</em>.) The late Dr Mullens, who also travelled up in
a similar way in 1873, said it reminded him of a picture in <cite>Punch</cite>,
of a heavy swell driving himself in a very small basket carriage,
and being remarked on by a street arab to his companion thus:
“Hallo, Bill, here’s a cove a-driving hisself home from the
wash.” My companion’s <em>filanjàna</em> was a much simpler contrivance
than mine, and consisted merely of two light poles held
together by iron bars, and with a piece of untanned hide nailed
to them for a seat. It was much more conveniently carried in
the forest than my larger and more cumbrous conveyance. It
may be added that certainly one was sometimes danced about
“like a pea in a frying-pan” in this rude machine; and it was not
long before a much more comfortable style of <em>filanjàna</em> was
adopted, with leather-covered back and arms, padded as well
as the seat, and with foot-rest, and leather or cloth bags strapped
to the side for carrying books and other small articles.</p>

<p>It was a fine warm day when we set off, the temperature not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
being higher than that of ordinary summer weather in England.
Our course lay due south, at no great distance from the sea,
the roar of whose waves we could hear distinctly all through the
first stage of the journey. In proceeding from Tamatave to
Antanànarìvo the road did not (and still does not, by railway)
lead immediately into the interior, but follows the coast for about
fifty miles southward. Upon reaching Andòvorànto, we had to
leave the sea and strike westward into the heart of the island,
ascending the river Ihàroka for nearly twenty miles before
climbing the line of mountains which form the edge of the
interior highland, and crossing the great forest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL LIFE</div>

<p>We soon left Tamatave behind us and got out into the open
country, a portion of the plain which extends for about thirty
miles between the foothills and the sea. Our men took us this
first day’s journey of nine or ten miles at a quick walk or trot
for the whole way, without any apparent fatigue. The road—which
was a mere footpath, or rather several footpaths, over a
grassy undulating plain—was bounded on one side by trees,
and on the other by low bushes and shrubs. Besides the cocoanut-palms
and the broad-leaved bananas, which were not here
very numerous, the most striking trees to a foreigner were the
agave, with long spear-shaped prickly leaves, on a high trunk,
and another very similar in form, but without any stem, both of
which might be counted by thousands. Nearer the sea was an
almost unbroken line of pandanus, which is one of the most
characteristic features of the coast vegetation. I also noticed
numbers of orchids on the trees, of two or three species of
<i>Angræcum</i>, but just past the flowering; a smaller orchid, also
with pure white flowers, was very abundant.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">A NATIVE HOME</div>

<p>I had enough to engage my attention with these new forms of
vegetation, as well as in noticing the birds, and the many butterflies
and other insects which crossed our path every moment,
until we arrived at Hivòndrona, a large straggling village on a
broad river of the same name, which here unites with other
streams and flows into the sea. Among the many birds to be
seen were flocks of small green and white paroquets, green
pigeons, scarlet cardinal-birds, and occasionally beautiful little
sun-birds (<i>Nectarinidæ</i>) with metallic colours of green, brown and
yellow. We had intended to go farther, but finding that, owing
to our late starting, we should not reach another village before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
dark, we decided to stay of Hivòndrona for the night. A house
at most of the villages on the road to the capital was provided
for travellers, who took possession at once, without paying anything
for its use. The house here, which was somewhat better
than at most of the other places, consisted, like all the dwellings
in this part of the country, of a framework of poles, thatched
with the leaves of the traveller’s tree, and the walls filled in
with a kind of lathing made of the stalks of the same leaves.
The walls and floor were both covered with matting, made from
the fibre of leaves of the <em>rofìa</em> palm. In one corner was the fireplace,
merely a yard and a half square of sand and earth, with
half-a-dozen large stones for supporting the cooking utensils.
As in most native houses, the smoke made its way out through
the thatch.</p>

<p>Our men soon came up with the baggage and proceeded to get
out kitchen apparatus, make a fire, and put on pots and pans;
and in a short time beef, fowls and soup were being prepared.
Meanwhile Mr Plant and I walked down to the seashore and then
into the village, to call upon a creole trader, who was the only
European resident in the place. We brought him back with
us, and found dinner all ready on our return to the house. My
largest case of drawing boards formed, when turned upside down
and laid on other boxes, an excellent table; we sat round on
other packages, and found that one of our bearers, who officiated
as cook, was capable of preparing a very fair meal; and although
the surroundings were decidedly primitive, we enjoyed it all
the more from its novelty. After our visitor had left us we
prepared to sleep; three or four boxes, with a rug and my
clothes-bag, formed a comfortable bed for myself, while Mr Plant
lay on the floor, but found certain minute occupants of the house
so very active that his sleep was considerably disturbed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIGANTIC ARUMS</div>

<p>Next morning we were up long before daybreak, and after a
cup of coffee started a little before six o’clock. We walked down
to the river, which had to be crossed and descended for some
distance, and embarked with our baggage in seven canoes.
These canoes, like those at Tamatave, are somewhat rude contrivances,
and are hollowed out of a single tree. They are of
various lengths, from ten to thirty or forty feet, the largest
being about four feet in breadth and depth. There is no keel,
so that they are rather apt to capsize unless carefully handled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
and loaded. At each end is a kind of projecting beak, pierced
with a hole for attaching a mooring-rope. From the smoothness
of the sides, and the great length compared with the beam,
they can be propelled at considerable speed with far less exertion
than is required to move a boat of European build. Instead of
oars, paddles shaped like a wooden shovel are employed, and
these are dug into the water, the rower squatting in the canoe
and facing the bows; the paddle is held vertically, a reverse
motion being given to the handle. We went a couple of miles
down the stream, which here unites with others, so that several
islands are formed, all the banks being covered with luxuriant
vegetation. Conspicuous amongst this, and growing in the
shallow water close to the banks, were great numbers of a
gigantic arum endemic in Madagascar (<i>Typhonodorum lindleyanum</i>),
and growing to the height sometimes of twelve or
fifteen feet, and possessing a large white spathe of more than
a foot in length, enclosing a golden-yellow pistil, or what looks
like one. The leaves are most handsome and are about a yard
long. After about twenty minutes’ paddling we landed, and,
when all our little fleet had arrived, mounted our palanquins,
and set off through a narrow path in the woods. The morning
air, even on this tropical coast, was quite keen, making an overcoat
necessary before the sun got up.</p>

<p>Our road for some miles lay along cleared forest, with stumps
of trees and charred trunks, white and black, in every direction.
It is believed that the white ants are responsible for this destruction
of the trees. We saw numbers of a large crow (<i>Corvus
scapulatus</i>), not entirely black, like our English species, but
with a broad white ring round the neck and a pure white breast,
giving them quite a clerical air. This bird, called <em>goàika</em> by the
Malagasy—evidently an imitation of his harsh croak—is larger
than a magpie, and his dark plumage is glossy bluish-black.
He is very common everywhere in the island, being often seen
in large numbers, especially near the markets, where he picks
up a living from the refuse and the scattered rice. He is a bold
and rather impudent bird, and will often attack the smaller
hawks. There were also numbers of the white egret (<i>Ardea
bubulcus</i>) or <em>vòrom-pòtsy</em> (<em>i.e.</em> “white bird”), also called <em>vòron-tìan-òmby</em>
(<em>i.e.</em> “bird liked by cattle”), from their following the
herds to feed upon the ticks which torment them. One may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
often see these egrets perched on the back of the oxen and thus
clearing them from their enemies. Wherever the animals were
feeding, these birds might be seen in numbers proportionate to
those of the cattle. This egret has the purest white plumage,
with a pale yellow plume or crest, and is a most elegant and
graceful bird.</p>

<p>The oxen of Madagascar have very long horns, and a large
hump between the shoulders. In other respects their appearance
does not differ from the European kinds, and the quality
and flavour of the flesh is not much inferior to English beef.
The hump, which consists of a marrow-like fat, is considered
a great delicacy by the Malagasy, and when salted and eaten
cold is a very acceptable dish. When the animal is in poor
condition the hump is much diminished in size, being, like that
of the camel in similar circumstances, apparently absorbed into
the system. It then droops partly over the shoulders. These
Malagasy oxen have doubtless been brought at a rather remote
period from Africa; their native name, <em>òmby</em>, is practically the
same as the Swahili <em>ngombe</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CURIOUS CRABS</div>

<p>We reached Trànomàro (“many houses”) at half-past nine,
and there breakfasted. My bearers proved to be a set of most
merry, good-tempered, willing fellows. As soon as they got
near the halting-places they would set off at a quick run, and
with shouts and cries carry me into the village in grand style,
making quite a commotion in the place. Leaving again at noon,
in a few minutes we came down to the sea, the path being close
to the waves which were rolling in from the broad expanse of the
Indian Ocean. I was amused by the hundreds of little red crabs,
about three inches long, taking their morning bath or watching
at the mouth of their holes, down which they dived instantaneously
at our approach. One or more species of the Madagascar
crabs has one of its pincers enormously enlarged, so that it is
about the same size as the carapace, while the other claw is
quite rudimentary. This great arm the little creature carries
held up in a ludicrous, threatening manner, as if defying all
enemies. I was disappointed in not seeing shells of any size
or beauty on the sands. The only ones I then observed
which differed from those found on our own shores were a
small bivalve of a bluish-purple hue, and an almost transparent
whorled shell, resembling the volute of an Ionic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
capital, but so fragile that it was difficult to find a perfect
specimen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEA SHELLS</div>

<p>But although that portion of the shore did not yield much of
conchological interest, there are many parts of the coasts of
Madagascar which produce some of the most beautifully marked
species of the genus <i>Conus</i> (<i>Conus tessellatus</i> and <i>C. nobilis</i>,
if I am not mistaken, are Madagascar species), while large
handsome species of the <em>Triton</em> (<i>T. variegatum</i>) are also found.
These latter are often employed instead of church bells to call
the congregations together, as well as to summon the people
to hear Government orders. A hole is pierced on the side of the
shell, and it requires some dexterity to blow it; but the sound
is deep and sonorous and can be heard at a considerable distance.
The circular tops of the cone shells are ground down to a thin
plate and extensively used by the Sàkalàva and other tribes as
a face ornament, being fixed by a cord on the forehead or the
temples. They are called <em>félana</em>. I have also picked up
specimens, farther south, of <i>Cypræa</i> (<i>C. madagascariensis</i>), a
well-known handsome shell, as well as of <em>Oliva</em>, <em>Mitra</em>, <em>Cassis</em>,
and others (<i>C. madagascariensis</i>). The finest examples are,
however, I believe, only to be got by dredging near the shore.</p>

<p>After some time we left the shore and proceeded through the
woods, skirting one of those lagoons which run parallel with
the coast nearly all the way from Tamatave to Andòvorànto.
A good recent map of Madagascar will show that on this coast,
for about three hundred miles south of Hivòndrona, there is a
nearly continuous line of lakes and lagoons. They vary in
distance from the sea from a hundred yards to a couple of miles;
and in many places they look like a very straight river or a broad
canal, while frequently they extend inland, spreading out into
extensive sheets of water, two or three miles across. This
peculiar formation is probably owing, in part at least, to slight
changes of level in the land, so that the inner banks of the
lagoons were possibly an old shore-line. But this chain of
lagoons and lakes is no doubt chiefly due to east coast rivers
being continually blocked up at their outlets by bars of sand,
driven up by the prevailing south-east trade-wind and the
southerly currents. So that the river waters are forced back
into the lagoons until the pressure is so great that a breach is
made, and the fresh water rushes through into the sea. On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
account of these sand-bars, hardly any east coast river can be
entered by ships. The rivers, in fact, flow for the most of the
time, not into the sea, but into the lagoons. These are not perfectly
continuous, although out of that three hundred miles
there are only about thirty miles where there are breaks in their
continuity and where canoes have to be hauled for a few hundred
yards, or for a mile or two, on the dry land separating them.</p>

<p>It will at once occur to anyone travelling along this coast,
as we did, that an uninterrupted waterway might be formed by
cutting a few short canals to connect the separate lagoons, and
so bring the coast towns into communication with Tamatave.
That enlightened monarch, Radàma I. (1810-1828), did see this,
and several thousand men were at one time employed in connecting
the lagoons nearest Tamatave; but this work was
interrupted by his death and never resumed by his successors.
But soon after the French conquest the work was again taken
in hand; canals were excavated, connecting all the lakes and
lagoons between Tamatave and Andòvorànto; and for about
twelve years a service of small steamers took passengers and
goods between Hivòndrona and Brickaville, where, until quite
recently, the railway commenced. Since the line of rails has
now been completed direct to Tamatave, this waterway will
not be of the same use, at least for passenger traffic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COAST SCENERY</div>

<p>The scenery of this coast is of a very varied and beautiful
nature, and the combinations of wood and water present a series
of pictures which constantly recalled some of the loveliest
landscapes that English river and lake scenery can present.
Our route ran for most of the way between the lagoons and the
sea, among the woods. On the one hand we had frequent
glimpses through the trees of sheets of smooth water fringed
by tropical vegetation, and on the other hand were the tumbling
and foaming waves of the ever-restless sea. In many places
islands studded the surface of the lakes, and I noticed thousands
of a species of pandanus, with large aerial roots, spreading out as
if to anchor it firmly against floods and violent currents. In
the woods were the gum-copal tree and many kinds of palms
with slender graceful stems and crowns of feathery leaves.
The climbing plants were abundant, forming ropes of various
thicknesses, crossing from tree to tree and binding all together
in inextricable confusion, creeping on the ground, mounting to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
the tree-tops and sometimes hanging in coils like huge serpents.
Great masses of <ins class="corr" id="tn-38" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'hartstongue fern'">
hart’s-tongue fern</ins> occurred in the forks of the
branches, and wherever a tree trunk crossed over our path it
was covered with orchids.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A POISON TREE</div>

<p>Among other trees I recognised the celebrated tangèna,
from which was obtained the poison used in Madagascar from
a remote period as an ordeal. The tangèna is about the size of
an ordinary apple-tree, and, could it be naturalised in England,
would make a beautiful addition to our ornamental plantations.
The leaves are peculiarly grouped together in clusters and are
somewhat like those of the horse-chestnut. The poison was
procured from the kernel of the fruit, and until the reign of
Radàma II. (1861) was used with fatal effect for the trial of
accused persons, and caused the death of thousands of people,
mostly innocent, every year during the reign of the cruel
Rànavàlona I.</p>

<p>We arrived at Andrànokòditra, a small village with a dozen
houses, early in the afternoon. From our house there was a
lovely view of the broad lake with its woods and islands, while
the sea was only two or three hundred yards’ distance in the rear.
Wild ducks and geese of several kinds were here very plentiful,
but my friend was not very successful with his gun, as a canoe
was necessary to reach the islands where they chiefly make their
haunts. After our evening meal Mr Plant slung his hammock
to the framework of our hut, and happily did not come to grief,
as occasionally happened. I was somewhat disturbed by the
cockroaches, which persisted in dropping from the roof upon and
around me. There was no remedy, however, except to forget
the annoyance in sleep.</p>

<p>I may here notice that when travelling along this coast a few
years later (in August 1883) the sands were everywhere almost
covered with pieces of pumice, varying from lumps as big as
one’s head to pieces as small as a walnut. They were rounded
by the action of the waves, and on some of the larger pieces
oysters, serpulæ and corals had begun to form. This pumice
had no doubt been brought by the ocean currents, as well as by
the winds, both setting to the west, from the Straits of Sunda,
where they were ejected by the tremendous eruption of
Krakatoa, off the west coast of Java, during the previous May.
This fact supplies not only an interesting illustration of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
distances to which volcanic products may be carried by ocean
currents, but also throws light upon the way in which the
ancestors of the Malagasy came across the three thousand miles
of sea which separate Madagascar from Malaysia. It is easy to
understand how, in prehistoric times, single <em>prahus</em>, or even
a small fleet of them, were occasionally driven westward by a
hurricane, and that the westerly current aided in this, until at
length these vessels were stranded or gained shelter on the coast
of Madagascar, stretching north and south, as it does, for a
thousand miles. From what I have been told, the pumice
was found, if not everywhere on the east coast, at any rate
over a considerable extent of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VARIETY OF FISH</div>

<p>We were up soon after four o’clock on the following morning,
and started while it was still twilight. After going a short
distance through the woods we came again to the seashore, and
proceeded for some miles close to the waves, which broke
repeatedly over our bearers’ feet as they tramped on the firm
wet sand. For a considerable distance there was only a low
bank of sand between the salt water of the ocean and the fresh
water of the lake. In many places the opposite shore showed
good sections of the strata, apparently a red sandstone, with a
good deal of quartz rock. We left the sea again and went on
through the woods, a sharp shower coming on as we entered
them. We did not notice any fish in the lagoons, but I was
afterwards informed by a correspondent, Mr J. G. Connorton,
who lived for several years at Mànanjàra, and paid much attention
to natural history, that there is a great variety of fish,
crustaceans and mulluscs in the lagoons and rivers, as well as
in the sea. He kindly sent me a list of about one hundred and
twenty of these, together with many interesting particulars as
to their habits and appearance, etc. From this account I will
give a few extracts:</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZÒMPONA</div>

<p>“<em>Ambàtovàzana</em>, a sea-fish which comes also into the entrance
of the rivers; it has silvery scales and yellow fins. In both
upper and lower jaws are four rows of teeth very like pebbles;
these are for crushing crabs, its usual food. Its name is derived
from its peculiarly shaped teeth (<em>vàto</em>, stone; <em>vàzana</em>, molar
teeth). <em>Botàla</em>, a small sea and river fish; it is covered all over
with rough prickles. These fish inflate their bodies by filling
their stomachs with air as soon as they are taken out of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
water; if replaced in the water suddenly, out goes the air, and
they are off like a flash. It is probably <em>Tetrodon fàhaka</em>.
<em>Hìntana</em>, a river-fish, with purple colouring and darker purple
stripes from back to belly. It is generally found among weeds,
and has four long spines, one on the dorsal fin, two just behind
the gills, and one close under the tail. These spines are very
poisonous, and anyone pricked by them suffers great pain for
several hours, the parts near the wound swelling enormously.
I have not, however, heard of the wound ever proving fatal.
<em>Horìta</em>, a small species of octopus found clinging to the rocks.
The Malagasy esteem them highly, but I found them gluey and
sticky in the mouth, as well as rank in flavour. <em>Tòfoka</em>, a sea
and river fish, probably <i>Mugil borbonicus</i>. It has a habit of
jumping out of the water, and if chased by a shark it swims at
the surface with great rapidity, making enormous leaps into the
air every now and then and often doubling upon the enemy.
Perhaps the best of the many edible fish is the <em>Zòmpona</em>, a kind
of mullet, only feeding on soft substances such as weeds. It is
silvery in colour, with large scales, and is probably the best-known
fish on the east coast. When fresh from the sea, its tail
and fins have a yellowish tinge, and it is then splendid eating;
but if this tinging is lost it shows that the fish has been for some
time in fresh water, and the flesh has a muddy flavour. It
varies in size from nine to thirty inches long. The coast people
are very fond of zòmpona; and when a person is dying and is so
far gone that the case is a hopeless one, some outsider is almost
sure to say, ‘He (or she) won’t get zòmpona again.’”</p>

<p>I can confirm my correspondent’s statements as to the
excellence of the last-named fish, having frequently eaten it
when on the coast. He also mentions several kinds of prawns
and shrimps; some of these are large and make an excellent
curry. One species of prawn, called <em>Oronkosìa</em>, is long and
slender, with immense antennæ, often a foot in length. One
species of shrimp has one large claw, like the crab already
mentioned, the other being hardly at all developed. Several
species of shark are seen off this coast, among them that
extraordinary-looking fish, the hammer-headed shark (<i>Zygæna
malleus</i>), which I have never seen in Madagascar waters, but
have noticed with great interest in South African harbours.
“The saw-fish (<i>Pristis sp.</i>), called by the natives <em>Vavàno</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
sometimes comes into the rivers in search of food. One was
caught in the river Mànanjàra which measured fourteen feet
from tip of saw to end of tail; the saw alone was three feet six
inches in length, seven inches broad at base, and four inches
at tip. The flesh is coarse eating, but the liver is very
palatable.”</p>

<p>I may remark here that we seldom stopped, either at midday
or in the evening, at any village without a visit from the
headman of the place and his family, who always carried some
present. Fowls, rice, potatoes, eggs and honey were constantly
brought to us, preceded by a speech in which the names and
honours of the Queen were recited, and compliments to us on
our visiting their village. The Malagasy are a most hospitable
people, always courteous and polite to strangers; and my first
experience of them on this journey was confirmed in numberless
instances in travelling in other parts of the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DELIGHTFUL SCENERY</div>

<p>Leaving Vavòny, where we had our morning repast, between
eleven and twelve o’clock, we went on again through the woods
along the shores of the lake, which here spreads out into broad
sheets of water, two or three miles wide. The scenery was
delightful, both shores being thickly wooded, reminding me in
some places of the Wye, in others of the lake at Longleat, and
in narrow parts of Studley Park. Our road for miles resembled
a footpath through a nobleman’s park in England: clumps of
trees, shrubberies, and short smooth turf, all united to complete
the resemblance. These all seemed more like the work of some
expert landscape gardener than merely the natural growth.
In some parts, where the more distinctly tropical vegetation—pandanus,
cacti and palms—were not seen, the illusion was
complete. In many places we saw many sago palms (<i>Cycas
thouarsii</i>), a tree much less in height than the majority of the
palms and not exceeding twelve or fourteen feet, but with
the same long pinnate leaves characteristic of so many of
the Palmaceæ.</p>

<p>One of the most conspicuous trees on this coast, especially as
seen from the sea, is the <em>Filào</em> (<i>Casuarina equisetifolia</i>), a tall
larch or fir-like tree, often called, from the colour of its wood,
“the beefwood tree.” Like the firs, its leaves are fine filaments,
and the wind passing through these produces a peculiar gentle
sighing noise. Very plentiful, too, is a much smaller tree bearing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
a perfectly globular-shaped fruit as large as a good-sized orange,
but having a hard shell which requires a smart blow to crack.
It contains a greyish pulp, and a number of large black seeds;
and although by no means equal to an orange in taste, its acid
flavour was refreshing enough where one was thirsty and heated
with the midday sun. A friend of mine remarks: “As they
are rather more difficult to eat in a cleanly and dainty fashion
than ripe mangoes, we smeared ourselves pretty considerably in
the process.” While the pulp is edible, the seeds are poisonous,
and we need not wonder at that when we find that the tree is
closely allied to the <i>Strychnos nux-vomica</i>. Its native name is
<em>Vòavòntaka</em> (<i>Brehmia spinosa</i>); <em>vòa</em> is the general word for
“fruit,” and enters into the composition of more than two
hundred Malagasy names of trees, plants and fruits. A species
of <i>Hibiscus</i> is widely spread along the coast, and yields a valuable
fibre. The natives say that its flowers are yellow in the morning
and red in the evening. Other noticeable flowering shrubs here
are a species of <i>Stephanotis</i>, with lovely large white flowers, and
an <i>Ipomæa</i>, which straggles far and wide on the sand of the seashore.
Along the sides of the lagoons and marshes in scattered
places may be found the curious pitcher-plant (<i>Nepenthes
madagascariensis</i>); this is a shrub about four feet high, whose
jug-shaped pitchers, four to five inches in length, contain abundant
water and numerous insects. Gum-copal is obtained from
a tree (<i>Trachylobium verrucosa</i>) growing on this coast; and
india-rubber from several plants (<i>Landolphia madagascariensis</i>
and <i>L. gummifera</i>), creepers as well as trees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOSQUITOES</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the beauty of this part of the country, it is
very unhealthy for foreigners. The rivers, as we have seen, all
communicate with the lagoons, and during the rainy season
great quantities of decaying matter are brought down from the
forests. The large extent of marsh and stagnant water in the
lakes breed millions of mosquitoes, and so give rise to the dreaded
malarial fever. The earlier accounts of the French and
Portuguese settlements on the coast of Madagascar represent
this as a frightful scourge, sweeping off a large proportion of the
soldiers and settlers at their forts. From this, the Isle Ste Marie
was called the “Grave of the French,” and “the Churchyard”
and “Dead Island” of the Dutch. But the use of quinine and
modern precautions against mosquito bites have done much to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
mitigate the attacks of fever, and since the draining of the
marshes near Tamatave the town is said to be fairly healthy.</p>

<p>The Bétsimisàraka inhabitants of this coast are accustomed
to place their dead in rude coffins hollowed out of the trunk of
a tree and covered with a roof-shaped lid. But these are not
buried, but are placed on the ground in little groups, in a sheltered
grove of trees. In the case of wealthy people, the coffins are put
on a kind of trestle, and sometimes are protected from the rain
by having a shed fixed over them. This custom, it may be
imagined, is not, for the living, a pleasant mode of disposing of
the departed, and the presence of these little cemeteries may
often be deduced from the effluvium, even if they are not seen.
During the dry season one constantly meets with groups of
people carrying up the remains of their relatives, Hova who
have died on the coast, in order that they may be buried in their
ancestral tombs. Sometimes we have had our midday meal, or
have stopped for the night, in houses against whose outer walls
these wrapped-up corpses, fastened to long poles for carriage,
have been leaning. At one place where we stayed the people
were making cakes for the funeral feast, and in pounding
the rice for these the women made a special rhythmical beat
of their pestles on the top of the rice mortar, as well as on the
meal in the hollow of the mortar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SNAKES</div>

<p>But to return to our journey. At about two o’clock we had
to cross the lake, but as there was only one small canoe, it took
more than two hours to get all our baggage and men over.
We therefore strolled into the woods, finding plenty to interest
us in examining the orchids, ferns, and other plants, most of
them new to me. We captured a new and splendid spider, new
to my companion, who had made entomology his special study.
We were amused by the little land-crabs, with their curious
stalked eyes, folding down into a case, when not raised to look
about them. There were also many beautifully marked lizards,
as well as other interesting living creatures in these tropical
woods. The ferry was close to a village bearing the name of
Andàvaka-mènaràna—that is, “hole of serpents.” Notwithstanding
this ominous appellation, we were not startled from
our path by even a solitary reptile, although a cave not far
distant is said to be a lurking-place for numbers of these creatures.
But on a subsequent journey along this coast I saw a large and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
handsome brown serpent on the grass close to the path. I got
down, not to kill it, but to examine its beautiful markings and
graceful movements; but on getting near it, which was not
easy to do, as its movements were so rapid, it turned and faced
me in a menacing fashion. Happily, although there are many
species of serpents in Madagascar, not one is a venomous kind—that
is, their bite is not fatal. At the same time there are some
kinds which will bite severely if attacked. Later on, I saw
another much smaller snake, of a bright green colour, on the
trunk of a tree; doubtless its tints were protective. The larger
one I saw is called <em>Màndotra</em>, and was from three to four feet
long; another species found on the coast is called <em>Màntangòra</em>,
and is a foot or more longer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BOA</div>

<p>While on the subject of serpents, I will add here some particulars
my friend, Mr Houlder, gives of yet another of these
reptiles seen on this east coast, but farther north. This kind is
called <em>Akòma</em> (<i>Pelophilus madagascariensis</i>), and appears to be
a species of boa, killing fowls, rats and other creatures first by
crushing them, and then covering them with saliva before
swallowing. At a village he stayed in, my friend found the
people much excited about a large serpent seen in their neighbourhood.
Sending out his men to find it, “at last the creature
was seen. Yes, there he was, a villainous-looking monster,
apparently asleep, coiled up among the bushes with his great
flat head in the middle of the circle. The gun was loaded with
several pistol bullets. Luckily it was, perhaps, for the duck-shot
sent into him at the next discharge only just penetrated his
thick scaly skin. Advancing to within a couple of yards or so,
I raised the gun. Bang! Away went the onlookers for their
lives. Peering through the smoke which was slowly moving
away, I could just see the head coming towards me. Enough,
I bolted too. This caused a second stampede. But it was a
groundless alarm. I looked back, and saw that the poor
creature was incapable of doing serious injury. His back was
hopelessly broken. No other shot was necessary.” Mr
Houlder did not get the serpent to his house without difficulty,
owing to the terror of the bearers even when it was dead. “It
was a medium-sized specimen, about nine feet long and as
thick round the middle as the calf of a man’s leg. On each side
of its body was a long yellow, black, and reddish chain-like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
marking on a brown ground; and near the extremity of its
tail were two abortive claws. Muscular motion did not cease
until long after it was dead.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEMURS</div>

<p>Although we did not see any lemurs in the coast woods, one
species at least is, or, at least, was, sometimes met with—viz.
the white-fronted lemur (<i>Lemur mongos</i>, <i>var. albifrons</i>).
Several specimens of this kind have been brought to England
from time to time, and have been kept in the Regent’s Park
Zoological Gardens from as long ago as 1830; so that their
appearance and habits are as well known to English people as
to the Malagasy themselves. Their habits are simple enough.
They often exhibit great vivacity, and are much given to
leaping from one object to another, in which they are aided by
the pad-like structure of the soles of their four hands. They
are very good-natured and tame and full of fun while still young,
but become cross and vicious when old. We shall, however, see
and hear more of the lemurs when we come into the denser
forests.</p>

<p>A little before dusk we arrived at Andòvorànto, a large
village situated at the mouth of the river Ihàroka, and formerly
the capital of the Bétsimisàraka tribe, before they were reduced
to subjection by the Hova. This place would be the natural
port of the capital, but for the bar of sand at the entrance of
the river. Were it not for this obstruction, ships and steamers
could come up into the interior for many miles. The house in
which we stayed here was quite a large one, divided into three
rooms, the walls covered with <em>rofìa</em> matting, and actually
possessing <em>windows</em> (but, of course, without glass) and doors.
All the places where we had stayed previously had no windows,
and a mat hung over the entrance supplied the place of
a door.</p>

<p>While our dinner was being prepared we walked down to the
sea and along the river banks, hoping to find some natural
history specimens. During our walk Mr Plant related to me
his success in obtaining a specimen of that remarkable creature,
the aye-aye, an animal peculiar to Madagascar, and of which,
at that time, only one or two specimens had reached Europe.
The example he secured was sent to England in spirits, and
from it, I believe, Sir Richard Owen prepared his monograph,
giving full details and drawings, life size, showing its remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
structure. The animal, although apparently not scarce, is
difficult to obtain, as it comes out from its retreat only at night;
besides which, the forest people have a superstitious fear of it,
so that even a large reward is often insufficient to induce them
to attempt its capture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE AYE-AYE</div>

<p>The aye-aye is included among the four-handed animals, but
it is very unlike the monkeys, having a smaller brain and much
less intelligence; and from its powerful teeth it was at first
thought to be a link between them and the rodentia, or gnawing
animals. Its structure presents some of the most interesting
illustrations of typical forms, being modified to serve special
ends that any animal organisation can exemplify. The food
of the aye-aye consists of a wood-boring larvæ, which tunnels
into the wood of certain trees. To obtain these, the animal
is furnished with most powerful chisel-shaped incisor teeth, with
which it cuts away the outer bark. As, however, the grub
retreats to the end of its hole, one of the fingers of the aye-aye’s
hands is slightly lengthened, but much diminished in thickness,
and is finished with a hook-like claw. Thus provided, the
finger is used as a probe, inserted in the tunnel, and the dainty
morsel drawn forth from its hiding-place. There are also other
modifications, all tending to the more perfect accomplishment
of the purposes of its creation: the eyes being very large to see
in the night, the ears widely expanded to catch the faint sound
of the grub at work, and the thumbs of the feet largely developed
so as to enable the animal to take a firm hold of the tree while
using its teeth.</p>

<p>Since then, living specimens of the aye-aye have been sent to
Europe, and careful observations were made for several months
on the habits of one in the Regent’s Park Gardens; and other
information has been obtained as to the animal as observed in
its native forests by intelligent natives. The creature somewhat
resembles a large cat in size, being about three feet in
total length, of which its large bushy tail forms quite half. Its
colour is dark brown, the throat being yellowish-grey; a somewhat
silvery look is given to the fur in certain lights by many
whitish hairs on the back. The probe finger is used as a scoop
when the aye-aye drinks; it is carried so rapidly from the
water to the mouth that the liquid seems to pass in a continual
stream. A remarkable fact has been pointed out in the structure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
of the lower jaw—namely, that the two sides are only joined
together by a strong ligament, and do not, as in other animals,
form one connected circle of bone. This accounts for the
prodigious power of gnawing that the aye-aye possesses. It
was seen to cut through a strip of tin-plate nailed to the door of
its cage.</p>

<p>The aye-aye constructs true nests, about two and a half feet
in diameter, which are found on trees in the dense parts of the
forest. Near the coast these are composed of rolled-up leaves
of the traveller’s tree, and are lined with twigs and dry leaves.
The opening of the nest is at the side, and a small white insect
called <em>andaitra</em>, probably the larva of some beetle, forms the
animal’s chief food. It is said to be very savage, and strikes
rapidly with its hands. The coast people believe it to be an
embodiment of their forefathers, and so will not touch it, much
less do it an injury; and if they attempted to entrap it, they
think they would surely die in consequence; and their superstition
extends even to its nest.</p>

<p>The aye-aye is one of the many instances which the animal
life of Madagascar presents of isolation from other forms. It
remains the only species of its genus, and, like many of the
peculiar birds of the island, is one of the many proofs that
Madagascar has for long ages been separated from Africa; so
that while allied forms have become extinct on the continent,
here, protected from the competition of stronger animals, many
birds, mammals and insects have been preserved, and so this
island is a kind of museum of ancient and elsewhere unknown
forms of life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<br />
<span class="fs70">FROM COAST TO CAPITAL: ANDÒVORÀNTO TO MID-FOREST</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">IT rained heavily during the night of Tuesday and nearly
until daybreak, so it was half-past six o’clock before we
were able to leave Andòvorànto. Hitherto we had
followed the seashore southwards; now we were to start westwards
into the interior. After an immense deal of shouting
and some quarrelling on the part of our bearers, who seemed to
think it necessary for everyone to give his opinion at the same
moment, we pushed off in six large canoes and paddled away
up the river Ihàroka. For several miles the stream is upwards
of a mile in width. It was a fine calm morning after a stormy
night, and as we glided rapidly over the broad smooth expanse
of water, and turned our canoe’s prow towards the interior
mountains, I began really to feel that I was on my way to the
capital.</p>

<p>After half-an-hour we came to a point where the river is a
junction of three streams, the one we took being about half the
width of the main current. We passed many canoes and overtook
others; some of these were filled with rice and other produce,
and had but a single rower; he sat generally at the stern
and gave a few strokes with the paddle on each side of the
canoe alternately, so as to keep the craft in a fairly straight
course through the water. Other canoes were filled with what
was evidently a family party, going together to some market
held in one of the neighbouring villages. Our men seemed to
enjoy the exercise of paddling, which was a change from bearing
our palanquins and baggage on their shoulders, and they took
us up the stream at a great speed. More than once, indeed, I
wished they had been less vigorous, for they commenced racing
with the other crews, making me not a little apprehensive of
being upset. It would not have mattered much to them, as
they swam fearlessly and had nothing to lose; but it would
have been unpleasant and dangerous for us, even apart from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
the risk of crocodiles, which abound in most of the rivers of
Madagascar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CROCODILES</div>

<p>These reptiles are so numerous in many parts as to be a great
pest; they often carry off sheep and cattle, and not unfrequently
women and children who incautiously go into or even
near the water. The Malagasy, however, have a superstitious
dread of these monsters, which prevents them from attempting
to kill them. They rather try to propitiate the creature by
prayers and offerings thrown into the water, and by acknowledging
its supremacy in its own element. At Itàsy, a lake
fifty miles west of the capital, the people believe that if a
crocodile be killed a human life will, within a very short time,
be exacted by the animal’s brother reptiles, as an atonement
for his death. Two or three French travellers once shot a
crocodile in this lake, and such was the people’s consternation
and dread of the consequences that their visitors found it
expedient to quit the neighbourhood as quickly as possible.
The eggs of the crocodile are collected and sold for food in the
markets, and are said to be perfectly good, but I confess I never
brought myself to test their merits.</p>

<p>We kept near the banks of the river, and so were able to
examine and admire the luxuriant vegetation with which they
were covered. In many places the bamboo is conspicuous,
with its long-jointed, tapering stem, and its whorls of minute
leaves, of a light delicate green; but it is small here compared
with what we afterwards saw in the main forest. Plantations
of sugar-cane and manioc were mingled with banana-trees,
palms, pandanus and other trees, many not unlike English
forms. Numbers of great water-lilies with blue flowers were
growing in the shallow water, and convolvuli, as well as
numerous other flowers of new kinds and colours, everywhere
met the eye. The shores were flat at first, but became more
hilly, and the scenery more varied, as we proceeded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TRAVELLER’S TREE</div>

<p>As we sailed up the river the traveller’s tree (<i>Ravenala
madagascariensis</i>) became very plentiful, and soon gave quite
a peculiar character to the landscape. This remarkable and
beautiful tree belongs to the order which includes the plantains
and bananas, although in some points its structure resembles
the palm rather than the plantain. It is immediately recognised
by its graceful crown of broad green leaves, which grow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
at the top of its trunk in the form of an immense fan. The
leaves are from twenty to thirty in number, and are from eight
to ten feet long by a foot and a half broad. They very closely
resemble those of the banana, and when unbroken by the wind
have a very striking and beautiful appearance. The name of
“traveller’s tree” is given on account of its affording at all
times a supply of cool pure water upon piercing the base of the
leaf-stalk with a spear or pointed stick. This supply is owing
to the broad surface of the leaves, which condenses the moisture
of the atmosphere, and from which the water trickles down into
the hollow, where the leaf-stalks join the stem. Each of these
forms a little reservoir, in which water may always be found.
The leaves, as are also those of the banana, are used to beat the
thatched roofs in case of fire, on account of the amount of water
which they contain.</p>

<p>The name of “builder’s tree” might be given to it with equal
or greater propriety, for it is as useful to the coast people as the
cocoanut-palm is to the South Sea islanders. The leaves are
used for thatching, and the long leaf-stems fastened together
form the filling-in of the framework for the walls and partitions;
the bark is beaten out flat and forms the flooring; while the
trunk supplies timber for the framing. Quantities of the fresh
leaves are used every day and take the place of plates and
dishes; and at the New Year’s festival the <em>jàka</em>, or meat eaten
at that time, was always served up, together with rice, upon
pieces of the leaves of this tree or of the banana; and a kind of
spoon or ladle was, and is still, formed, made by twisting up
part of a leaf and tying it with the tendrils of some climbing
plant. The tree ranges from the sea-coast to the height of
about fifteen hundred feet, after which it begins rapidly to
disappear. At an elevation of about a thousand feet it is
extremely abundant, much more so, in fact, than any other
tree, and is the one striking and peculiar feature in the vegetation.
It is not found so much in the forests as on the hillsides in
the open country; it has some half-dozen or more different
names among the various tribes on the eastern side of the
island.</p>

</div>

<p>Our canoe voyage was nearly twenty miles in length, the last
two or three up a narrow creek not above twenty or thirty feet
in width. In one of the narrowest parts of the stream we were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
stopped by a tree which had fallen across the creek, just above
the surface of the water. With some trouble and difficulty the
canoes were each hoisted over the obstruction, the luggage
being shifted from one to another. Some friends who came up
about five months afterwards told me that the tree was still
there. Probably it had caused a stoppage hundreds of times,
yet no one dreamed of taking the little extra trouble necessary
to remove it altogether from the passage. It was just the same
in the forest: when a tree fell across the path, there it lay for
months until it rotted away. Palanquins had to be hoisted
over it, or with difficulty pushed beneath it, but it was never
removed until nature helped in the work. It was no one’s
business to cut it up, or to take it out of the way; there were
no “turnpike trusts,” and the native government never gave
themselves any concern about the matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COFFEE AND ORANGES</div>

<p>We were glad to land at Maròmby at ten o’clock, for rain
came on, and before we were well housed it poured down heavily
for some time. Here we got as dessert, after breakfast, a
quantity of wild raspberries, which, while not equal in flavour
to the English kind, are very sweet and refreshing. Close to
the house where we stayed for our meal was a coffee plantation;
the shrubs grow to a height of seven or eight feet, and have dark
glossy leaves, with a handsome white flower. The small
scarlet fruit, in which the seed—what we term the “berry”—is
enclosed, contains a sweetish juice. The coffee plant thrives
in most parts of the island, and its produce probably will
become an important part of its exports.</p>

<p>Near the house were also a number of orange-trees, and here
I had the gratification of seeing an orange grove with the trees
laden with thousands of the golden-hued fruit. We were
allowed to take as many as we liked, and as the day was hot and
sultry we were not slow to avail ourselves of the permission.
Perhaps there are few more beautiful sights than an orange
grove when the fruit is ripe on the trees. The “golden apples”
of the Hesperides must surely have been the produce of an
orange plantation.</p>

<p>The rain ceased after a time, but we did not get off until past
two o’clock, for our men became rather obstinate, and evidently
wanted to stay at Maròmby for the rest of the day. This we
were not at all disposed to allow. At last we started, and in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
few minutes had a specimen of the adventures that were in store
for us in passing through the forest. In attempting to ford a
stream, one of my men suddenly sank nearly to his waist in a
thick yellow mud. It was by the barest chance that I was not
turned over into the water; however, after some scrambling
from one man’s shoulder to another, I managed to reach dry
land. There was a shaky, rickety bridge a little higher up
the stream, and by this I contrived to get across.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIFFICULT TRAVELLING</div>

<p>We now struck right into the hills, up and down, down and
up, for nearly four hours. The road was a mere footpath, and
sometimes not even that, but the bed of a torrent made by the
heavy rains. It wound sometimes round the hills and sometimes
straight up them, and then down into the valleys at
inclinations difficult enough to get along without anything to
carry but oneself, but, with heavy loads, requiring immense
exertion. My palanquin described all kinds of angles; sometimes
I was resting nearly on my head, and presently almost on
my feet. When winding round the hills we were continually
in places where a false step of my bearers might have sent us
tumbling down sixty or seventy, and sometimes a hundred, feet
into the valley below. A dozen times or so we had to cross
streams foaming over rocks and stones, to scramble down to
which, and out again, were feats requiring no ordinary dexterity.
Again and again I expected to be tumbled over into the water
or down the rocks, the path being often steeper than the roof
of a house. Several times I got out and walked up and down
the hills in order to relieve the men; but I afterwards found
that I need not have troubled myself, as they easily carried me
up much steeper ascents. Some of these scenes were exceedingly
beautiful and, with the rushing, foaming waters, overhung
with palms, ferns, plantains and bamboos, made scores of scenes
in which a landscape artist would have delighted.</p>

<p>In passing along I was struck with the peculiar outline of the
hills; they are mostly rounded cones or <em>mamelle</em>-shaped, not
connected together in chains, but detached, so it appeared that
road-making would be very difficult and would have to be very
circuitous. In almost every sheltered hollow were clumps of
the traveller’s tree, together with palms and bamboos. The
hills increased in height as we advanced, while beyond them all
in the far distance we could see the line of the mountains forming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the edge of the central highland, and covered with dense
forest in every part. The scene, but for the tropical trees,
resembled the Lancashire and West Riding scenery, along the
Todmorden valley. As far as I could make out, the hills appeared
to be mostly of bright clay, interspersed with quartz.
Great black masses of gneiss rock crop out on the sides of many
of them in most curious, fantastic shapes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOT STREAMS</div>

<p>On the east coast and for some way westward there is no
distinct rainy season, as in the interior of Madagascar; it rains
more or less all through the year. The temperature did not
exceed that of warm summer days in England, with cool
mornings and evenings. We reached Rànomafàna as it was
getting dusk, my lads bringing me in, as usual, at a smart trot,
after doing fifteen or sixteen miles in less than four hours. The
name of this village means “hot waters,” and is derived from
some hot springs which bubble up in a small stream not far
from the houses. The water close to this spot is too hot to
touch with the hand or foot; but as it mingles with the cold
river water it soon becomes tepid, and I found that in wading
in the stream I could have any degree of heat or cold as I
chose. Many people come to bathe in these hot waters, and
find benefit in certain complaints.</p>

<p>At this place I procured specimens of that remarkable
vegetable production, the lace-leaf plant, or water yam
(<i>Ouvirandra fenestralis</i>). The existence of this plant had long
been known to botanists, but it was introduced into Europe by
the Rev. W. Ellis after his first visit to Madagascar (1853-1854);
and from plants brought by him to England it was propagated,
and specimens were sent to many of the chief botanical collections,
as well as to Kew, Chiswick and the Crystal Palace. I
knew of this plant being abundant in some of the streams on the
east side of the island, and I therefore described it as well as I
could to one of my bearers. A little time after our arrival at the
village he brought me three or four plants, together with the
roots, and in one case with the flower also attached. The
leaves were from six to eight inches long and an inch and a half
wide; but I afterwards found at Mauritius that they grew to
more than double this size in the Royal Gardens <ins class="corr" id="tn-53" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'at Pamplemouses'">
at Pamplemousses</ins>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LACE PLANT</div>

<p>As the name implies, the leaf is like a piece of lace-work, or,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
more strictly speaking, like a skeleton leaf, the spaces between
the veining being open. The veining is something like that of
a lily leaf, the longitudinal fibre running through the whole
length, and crossed at very regular intervals by the transverse
veins, which are of thread-like fineness. The specific name,
<i>fenestralis</i> (“windowed”), conveys this idea of a regular
arrangement of structure. The leaf-stalk varies in length with
the depth of the water, always keeping a little below the
surface. Each plant has ten or a dozen leaves branching from
the root, which in the specimens brought to me resembled a
small potato. It can be eaten, as its taste is like the farinaceous
yam, common to most tropical countries; and from this likeness
the generic name, <em>ouvirandra</em>, is derived—<em>ouvy</em> or <em>òvy</em> being
the native word for yam. The plant grows in running water and
thrives best in warm situations. The flower grows on a long
stalk and rises a little above the surface of the water; it is of
a pinkish colour, dividing into two curved hairy tufts. Few
objects can be imagined more beautiful or interesting for
cultivating in an aquarium than this lace-leaf plant, which Sir
W. J. Hooker termed “one of the most curious of nature’s
vegetable productions.” It is an endogenous plant, included
in the order <i>Juncaginaceæ</i>, to which the arrow-grasses and the
rushes belong; it is found not only in the eastern region, but
occurs in streams near the upper belt of forest in the interior.
It is said to be very tenacious of life, retaining its vitality even
if the stream where it grows is dried up; the leaves in their
various stages of growth pass through a gradation of colour,
from a pale yellow to a dark olive-green. When full grown, its
dark green leaves form the limit of a circle two or three feet in
diameter.</p>

<p>Taking a walk round the village before it was dark, I noticed
several houses raised on posts five or six feet above the ground.
At the top of each post, just under the floor, was a projecting
circle of wood a foot or more in diameter and polished very
smooth. I found that these buildings were granaries, and were
raised in this way to protect the rice from rats, which are a
great annoyance in most parts of the country. The smooth
ring of wood effectually prevented them from getting any
farther than the top of the upright posts. The ladder for
getting up to these granaries is a very primitive contrivance; it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
consists merely of a round pole with notches cut in the upper
side to prevent the foot from slipping. On a subsequent visit
to Madagascar my wife and I had to use one of these <em>tràno
àmbo</em> (“raised houses”), as they are called, as a bedroom, and
very clean and comfortable we found it, free from all insect
plagues; the floor was of plaited bamboo, springy to walk on,
although the getting up to it or down from it was a somewhat
difficult feat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OUR BEARERS</div>

<p>We were astir early on the Wednesday morning and left our
quarters at six o’clock. It was a beautiful morning as we commenced
our journey and began to mount hills and descend
valleys and cross streams as before—with this difference, that
the hills became higher and steeper, and the paths more difficult.
How our men managed to carry themselves up and down, to say
nothing of the heavy loads on their shoulders, puzzled me, but
they did their work apparently without much fatigue. I
noticed that many of those who carried heavy loads had the
flesh and muscles on the shoulders thickened into a sort of pad,
caused, I suppose, from the constant weight and friction of their
burdens. When carrying they wore but little clothing, merely
the <em>salàka</em> or loin-cloth, and sometimes a sleeveless jacket of
hempen cloth or other coarse material. In the cool mornings
they generally wore over the shoulders the <em>làmba</em><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of <em>rofìa</em>, or
of hemp cloth; but during the rest of the day this was bound
tightly round the waist, or thrown upon the palanquin. The
two sets of four bearers used to take the work in “spells” of
a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes at a time; when the
others relieved them they did not stop, but those taking the
poles of the palanquin would stoop under and take it on their
shoulders with hardly any jerk, even when running at full speed.
Occasionally one set would take the duty for an hour or more,
while if going fast, or on very difficult ground, they relieved
each other very frequently. Every three or four minutes they
changed the load from one shoulder to another, the leaders
lifting the pole over their heads.</p>

<p>In proceeding on our journey we met great numbers of men
bringing poultry, manioc, potatoes, rice, and other produce
from the interior to the coast. These articles are mostly
brought to Tamatave and other ports, so that the ships trading
to these places are supplied with abundance of provisions at a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
very moderate rate. The poultry were enclosed in large open
panniers or baskets made of strips of bamboo plaited together
and slung at each end of a bamboo or a pole of light wood. We
also overtook many men taking European goods up to the
capital—quantities of cheap and gaudily painted crockery, iron
cooking-pots, and a variety of other articles. Many also
carried salt, and others the same open wicker baskets in which
fowls are brought down, but now containing quantities of the
fibre of the <em>rofìa</em> palm. This is taken up into the interior to
be manufactured into cloth. Sometimes these men were met
singly, or two or three together, but more often they travelled
in companies of ten, twenty or thirty. Occasionally we met a
Hova officer in a palanquin borne by his slaves, and often with
his wife and other members of his family, also in palanquins,
with female slaves attending them and running at a good pace
to keep up with the men.</p>

<p>In one day we often saw a great variety of face and colour, and
met representatives of several of the different tribes which
people the island; and these differ considerably in colour and
features. Among the faces we saw, although there were few
that could be called handsome, judging by a European standard,
there was yet a large proportion of good heads, with high, well-formed
foreheads, and a general look of quickness and intelligence.
The impression given was certainly not that of a race
low in mental organisation or capabilities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NATIVE MUSIC</div>

<p>At Ambàtoharànana, where we breakfasted, we were favoured
with a little native music while our meal was being prepared.
The instrument consisted of a piece of bamboo about four feet
long, with parts of the strong outer fibre detached and strained
over small pieces of pumpkin shell like the bridge of a violin.
With this simple contrivance the performer produced a soft
plaintive kind of music, not unlike the tones of a guitar. This
instrument is called a <em>valìha</em>, and is played by the fingers. A
simpler and ruder musical effect is obtained by a kind of bow
of wood, with two or three strings, and to which, at one end, the
half of a large gourd is fixed to give resonance; this is called
<em>lokàngam-bòatàvo</em> (<em>vòatàvo</em>, pumpkin), but its sound is poor and
monotonous.</p>

<p>Although the paths we traversed were most difficult, the
scenery was singularly delightful. There are few more beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
forms in tropical vegetation than the bamboo, which unites the
most perfect symmetry and bright colour, and in some places
a particular species<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> gave quite a special character to the scenery.
The long elastic stems, thirty or forty feet in length, three inches
or more in diameter at the base, and tapering to a fine point,
were curving over the path in every direction, and with their
feathery whorls of leaves, yellowish-green in colour, growing
from every joint, were a constant delight to the eye. Sometimes
a whole valley seemed filled with bamboos; while in
others the <em>rofìa</em> palm and the tree-ferns were the prevailing
forms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RICHES OF THE COUNTRY</div>

<p>Our midday journey this day was a continual ascent, until
we were evidently at a considerable elevation above the sea.
From one ridge we had a most extensive prospect and could see
the Indian Ocean fifty or sixty miles behind us, while before us
was a yet higher chain of hills, dark with dense woods of the
main line of forest. As we rode along, I could not but observe
the capabilities of the country and its vast powers of production,
were it brought extensively under cultivation. The country is
rich also in mineral wealth—iron, gold, copper, and other metals,
as well as graphite and probably also petroleum.</p>

<p>We came this day into a belt of tree-ferns, some of large size,
with their great graceful fronds arranged horizontally in a circle
round the top of the trunk. There were also numbers of pine-apples
growing wild, with the magnificent scarlet flowers just
developing into fruit. We descended to, crossed, and for some
time went along a beautiful river, resembling in many parts
the Dove at Dovedale, and in others the Wharfe at Bolton.
The view from the top of an immense hill of the river winding
far below was most charming. The paths by which we ascended
and descended would have astonished us in England, but by
this time a moderately level and smooth path had become an
object of surprise. In some places there was only a narrow
passage between rocks overhung with vegetation, most picturesque,
but most difficult to travel by.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WEAVING</div>

<p>We got in early in the afternoon to Ampàsimbé, a rather
large village. While waiting for dinner we watched the women
at the opposite house preparing the material from which they
make the <em>rofìa</em> cloths, called <em>rabannas</em> in Mauritius. It is the
inner fibre of the long glass-like leaves of the <em>rofìa</em>-palm.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
cuticle on each side is peeled off, leaving a thin straw-coloured
fibrous substance, which is divided by a sort of comb into
different widths, according to the fineness or otherwise of the
material to be made. The fibre is very strong and is the common
substitute for string in Madagascar. In other villages we saw
the women weaving the cloth with most rude and primitive
looms, consisting merely of four pieces of wood fixed in the mud
floor of the house, and a framework of two or three pieces of
bamboo. The material they make, however, is a good, strong-looking
article, with stripes of various colours and patterns
woven into the stuff, and is extensively used by the poorer
classes. With the same simple loom the Hova women make
many kinds of woven stuffs; of hemp, cotton, <em>rofìa</em> fibre, and
of this last, mingled with silk or cotton, very pretty and useful
cloth of a straw colour, being made in this way. Of the strong
native silk they also weave very handsome <em>làmbas</em> of bright
and varied colours and patterns, such as used to be worn on all
festive occasions by the higher classes, as well as the more
sombre dark red <em>làmbas</em> which are used by all classes for
wrapping the dead.</p>

<p>We had now reached a part of the country where the <em>rofìa</em>
palm was the most prominent object in the vegetation, not on
the hills, however, like the traveller’s tree, but chiefly in the
valleys, where there is plenty of moisture. This palm grows
very abundantly and can easily be distinguished from the other
trees of its order. The trunk has a rough and rugged surface,
and this reaches the height of twenty to thirty feet; but the
leaves are its most striking feature; they are magnificent plumes,
of enormous length, quite as long as the trunk itself. The
midrib of these leaves has a very strong but light structure,
some four to five inches wide at the base, and on this account it
is largely used for ladders, for palanquin poles, for roofing, and
indeed for anything needing lightness as well as strength. On
these midribs are set a great number of grass-like pinnate
fronds, from which, as already noticed, string and fibre are
prepared for weaving. Great clusters of seeds (or fruits?),
which are enclosed in a shiny brown skin, hang down from the
top of the trunk. These are used for boxes to enclose small
articles, as jewellery, etc. At one part of our journey the only
road was through an extensive sheet of water, through which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
rose hundreds of <em>rofìas</em>, like the interior of some great temple,
a most peculiar and beautiful sight, the great fronds above us
quite shutting out the sunshine and making a green twilight
below them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A PLAGUE OF RATS</div>

<p>If we had been disposed to copy the titles of some popular
evening entertainments, the nights preceding this Wednesday’s
one might have been termed: “A Night with the Fleas,” and
“A Night with the Mosquitoes,” but this was emphatically
“A Night with the Rats.” We saw and heard them racing
round the eaves of the house before we lay down, but as soon
as the light was put out they descended and began to rattle
about our pots and pans in search of food. We got up and
fired a pistol among them, and this appeared for a time to
scare them away; but later on their attentions became so
personal that we were obliged to light a candle and keep it
burning on the floor all night. After this we had comparative
quiet, but before lighting the candle they had been scampering
over my companion in his hammock and over myself as I lay
on the floor.</p>

<p>Thursday’s journey, although shorter than that of most days,
was perhaps the most difficult of all, especially the morning
division of it—hills steeper than ever, and, if possible, rougher
footpaths, so that we were often obliged to get down and walk,
making the journey very fatiguing. For nearly three hours we
were passing through dense forest, and in some places the path
was really frightful. I do not wonder that a small company
of soldiers brought up in the early years of the century by
Captain Le Sage laid themselves down in despair at the difficulties
of the roads they had to traverse. I found along the
roadside several varieties of those beautiful-leaved plants,
veined with scarlet and buff, which were so much cultivated
in England about that time. Ferns of all kinds were very
abundant, from the minutest species to the great tree-fern.</p>

<p>Our afternoon’s journey took us for some distance along a
beautiful river which foamed and roared over the rocks in its
course, and which we forded repeatedly. The path was most
picturesque, but very fatiguing; in many places the track
could hardly be distinguished at all from the dense rank growth
of plants and long grass. We arrived at Béfòrona at one
o’clock and fully intended to have proceeded another stage, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
it was so early in the afternoon, but we found our men so
exhausted that we were obliged to stay there for the rest of the
day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOREST REGIONS</div>

<p>Here it may be noted that we had now entered some way into
the lower and wider of the two belts of dense forest which
extend for several hundred miles along the eastern side of
Madagascar, and cover the mountains which form the great
ramparts of the highland of the interior. There is continuous
forest from nearly the north of the island to almost the southern
extremity; its greatest width is about fifty miles, north of
Antongil Bay; but to the south of the Antsihànaka province
it divides into two. Of these two belts, the upper one, which
clothes the edge of the highland, is the narrowest, being not
much above ten or twelve miles across, but the lower belt is
from twice to three times that breadth. On the western side
of Madagascar there is no such continuous line of forest; there
are, it is true, many extensive portions covered with wood, but
in many places the vegetation consists more of scattered
clumps of trees; while in the south-west, which is the driest
part of the island, the prevailing trees and shrubs are euphorbia,
and are spiny in character. Mr Baron reckoned that an area
of nearly thirty thousand square miles of the whole surface is
forest-covered country. We shall have other opportunities of
examining these extensive forest regions, so all we need say
further at present about them is, that no one with any eye for
the beautiful and wonderful can pass through them without
astonishment and delight. The variety and luxuriance of the
foliage, the great height of many of the trees, the countless
creeping and climbing plants that cover their trunks and
branches, the multitude of lianas that bind everything together
in a maze of cordage and ropes, the flowers which sometimes
cover whole trees with a mass of colour, crimson, or golden, or
purple—all these make a journey through these Madagascar
forests a new pleasure and lead one to exclaim: “O Lord, how
manifold are Thy works!”</p>

<p>We were now also ascending towards the central highland of
the interior, which lies at an elevation of from five to six
thousand feet above the sea-level. Above this general elevation,
which, however, is broken up by lesser hills and mountains
in all directions, so that there is no level country except what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
have been the beds of ancient lakes, now dried up, the highest
mountains do not rise to great altitudes. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">massif</i> of
Ankàratra, which forms the south-western boundary of
Imèrina, the home of the Hova tribe, does not quite reach nine
thousand feet in height above the sea. Until quite recently
the summits of Ankàratra were always supposed to be the
highest points of the island, but it has lately been discovered
that there is a mountain called Ambòro, about eighty miles from
the northernmost point, which is still higher, being nine thousand
four hundred feet above sea-level. On my return to the
coast in 1867 I found how much less difficult the journey from
Antanànarìvo to Andòvorànto was than that in the opposite
direction, owing, of course, to our descending nearly five
thousand feet instead of ascending the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BÉFÒRONA</div>

<p>Béfòrona is situated in an almost circular valley, with a river
running through it and surrounded by forest-covered hills. The
village, like most in this part of the country, has the houses
arranged in a square. Their floors are generally raised a foot
or two above the surface of the ground, and are formed of bark,
beaten out flat and laid on bamboos. The framing and roof
are made of poles or bamboo, filled in with the stalks of the
traveller’s tree, and thatched with leaves of the same tree. In
the centre of these village squares was a flagstaff, and in others
a pole with the skulls and horns of bullocks fixed to it. These
are mostly memorials of the festivities connected with the last
observance of the circumcision ceremonies, which are very
important events with all the Malagasy tribes. We had a visit
from the wife of the chief of the village, who brought us a
present of fowls and rice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BLOW-GUN</div>

<p>After resting a while we strolled along one of the streams
with our guns, to try to obtain specimens of some of the birds
peculiar to the neighbourhood. On our way back we observed
some boys using an instrument called <em>tsìrika</em>, with which they
were able to kill small birds. It consists of a long and straight
palm stem, taken from a small and beautiful palm with a stem
resembling a bamboo. A small arrow, tipped with an iron
point, is inserted and is discharged by blowing at the larger end.
About three inches of the end has wool to fill up the aperture
and prevent any windage. They use this blow-gun with great
precision and can strike a mark at a considerable distance. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
very similar weapon, but with poisoned arrows, is used by the
Indians of South America in the countries bordering the
Amazon and its tributaries.</p>

<br />
<span class="fs70">FROM COAST TO CAPITAL: ALAMAZAOTRA TO ANTANÀNARÌVO</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">ON the Friday morning we left Béfòrona soon after five
o’clock and for nearly four hours were passing through
the forest, here known as that of Alamazaotra, over
the highest hills and the most difficult paths we had yet seen.
Certainly this day’s journey was the most fatiguing of any on
the whole route, so that when we reached our halting-place I
was thoroughly exhausted and glad to throw myself on the floor
and sleep for an hour or more. At one part of the road there is
a long slope of clay, known as “Fitomanìanòmby,” or “weeping-place
of the bullocks,” so called from the labour and difficulty
with which the poor animals mount the steep ascent on their
way down to the coast. In coming down this and similar places
the utmost care was necessary on the part of the bearers; but
they were very surefooted and patient and took every precaution
to carry their burden safely. In ascending we often
required the help of all eight men to drag the palanquin up to
the top. The villages in the heart of these vast woods are few
and far between. Our halting-place for breakfast consisted
merely of three or four woodcutters’ huts in a few square yards
of cleared ground.</p>

<p>Our afternoon’s work was much the same as that of the
morning. In many places the rain had made a perfect slough
of thick mud, and our men had hard work to get through. I
could not cease to wonder how my heavy luggage was brought
along. For a considerable distance our way lay along a most
romantic-looking stream, whose course was broken by great
masses and shelves of rock, reminding me of Welsh river
scenery. Often in the higher parts of the road, where the
rivers down in the gorges were hidden by the dense masses of
wood, we could hear the roar of waters in the otherwise profound
stillness of the forest. At the chief pass in this chain of
hills we passed a tremendous cliff of rock, which rises sheer out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
of the valley to a height (so it has been ascertained) of nearly
two thousand feet, certainly one of the grandest natural objects
I had ever seen. This stupendous mass is called Andrìambàvibé,
“Great Princess”; the large trees on the summit
looked like mere bushes seen from below.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUXURIANT FOLIAGE</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the fatigue of the journey, it was impossible
not to be struck with admiration and delight at the grandeur
of the vegetation. The profusion and luxuriance of vegetable
life were very extraordinary. There appeared to be few trees
of great girth of trunk, but their height was considerable,
especially in the valleys. High over all the other trees shot up
the tall trunks of many varieties of palms, with their graceful
crowns of feathery leaves. A dense undergrowth of shrubs,
tree-ferns, and dwarf palms made in many places quite a green
twilight; while overhead the branches were interlaced and
bound together by countless creeping and climbing plants,
whose rope-like tendrils crossed in all directions and made a
labyrinth which it was impossible to pass through. Occasionally
we came across large trees in flower, giving a glorious mass
of colour. With these exceptions, however, flowers were comparatively
few; and during subsequent journeys I have found
that it is true in Madagascar what Dr Alfred R. Wallace has
pointed out as characteristic of all tropical countries—viz. that
in the tropics are not to be found great masses of floral colour.
For these one must go to the temperate zones; foliage, overpowering
in its luxuriance and endless variety, is indeed to be
found in the tropics, but not the large extent of colour given
by heather, buttercups, primroses, or a field of poppies in
England.</p>

<p>The orchids, however, were very abundant. Wherever a
fallen tree hung across the path, there they found a lodging-place,
and beautified the decaying trunks with their exquisite
waxy flowers of pink and white. Although what has just been
said of wild flowers is true on the whole, there were a considerable
number to be seen, if carefully looked for. My bearers
soon perceived how interested I was in observing their novel
and curious forms, and brought to me all the different varieties
they could find, so that in the evening my palanquin contained
a collection of flowers and plants gathered during the day. I
managed to dry a few, but the greater part had to be thrown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
away, as I had no means of preserving them to take up to the
capital.</p>

<p>In some parts of the woods the different species of bamboo
give quite a distinct character to the vistas. Some of them
shoot up in one long slender jointed stem, with fringes of delicate
leaves, and hang over the paths like enormous whips. Another
kind, a climbing species, with stems no thicker than a quill,
clothes the lower trees with a dense mantle of pale green
drapery. As we got into the higher and cooler parts of the
forest, numbers of the trees had long pendent masses of feathery
grey lichen, a species of <em>Usnea</em>, giving them quite a venerable
appearance, and reminding me of the opening lines of Longfellow’s
“Evangeline”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stand like Druids of old, with voices sad and prophetic,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">ANIMAL LIFE IN THE FOREST</div>

<p>Although the vegetation was most luxuriant, I was surprised
and somewhat disappointed by the stillness of the forest, and
the few signs of animal life and the rarity of the song of birds.
It is true that at certain seasons the notes of many songsters
may be heard, and that in certain places the cries of different
species of lemur resound through the woods. Still, on the
whole, I had imagined that a tropical forest would be much
more visibly full of life. Subsequent experience and research
showed me that there <em>is</em> a considerable variety and number of
living creatures in these forests, but they have to be looked for,
and when found they are full of interest, as we shall see. It
may be noticed, too, that both bird and insect life are more
evident in the outskirts of the woods and in the occasional
openings among the trees than in the densest forest, all living
things delighting in sunlight.</p>

<p>From what has been already said it will be seen that the
flora of Madagascar presents many new and striking forms of
vegetable life; but its fauna is still more noteworthy, for it
presents one of the strangest anomalies in the geographical
distribution of animals. This zoological peculiarity consists
as much, or more, in what is wanting, as in what is present.
Separated from Africa by a channel not three hundred miles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
broad at one point, we should have supposed that Madagascar
would partake to a great extent of the same characteristics, as
regards animal life, as the neighbouring continent. But it is
really remarkably different. There is a strange absence of the
larger species of mammalia, and this statement applies not only
to the forests but to all parts of the island, the bare highlands
of the interior and the extensive lower plains of the west and the
south.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ABSENCE OF LARGE ANIMALS</div>

<p>First of all, the large carnivora are all wanting; there are
no lions, leopards, tigers, panthers, or hyenas. The large
thick-skinned animals, so plentiful in the rivers and forests of
Africa, have no representatives in Madagascar; no elephant
browses in the woods, no rhinoceros or hippopotamus lazily
gambols in the streams, although there was a small species of
the last-named pachyderm which was living during the latest
quaternary epoch. The numerous species of fleet-footed
animals—antelope, gazelle, deer, and giraffe, zebra and quagga—which
scour the African plains are entirely absent; and the
ox, the sheep, the goat, the horse and the ass have all been
introduced, the three former from Africa and the others from
Europe. The order of mammalia most developed here is the
quadrumana, but this, again, is represented by but a single
division, the lemurs and their allies, which are the most characteristic
animals of the island. There are no true monkeys,
baboons, or apes, nor do the gorilla or chimpanzee put in an
appearance. The lemurs are very distinct from all these and
are pretty creatures, bearing little resemblance to the half-human,
grotesque appearance of many of the quadrumanous
animals, or to the savage character of the larger apes and
baboons. They vary in size from that of a large monkey to
species not larger than a rat. They are mostly gentle in
disposition, and some kinds are tame enough to be kept about
the house as pets.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">MADAGASCAR AND AFRICA</div>

<p>It is probable that the mammalia of Madagascar are now
fairly well known, although a few of the smallest species may
still await discovery; and the following summary may be here
given of their divisions and numbers—excluding the bats, of
which there are seventeen species, ninety species of terrestrial
mammals have been classified and described, and of the following
orders:—Lemuroida, thirty-nine species; Carnivora,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
almost all being civets and quite small animals, ten species;
Insectivora, including shrews and small creatures resembling
hedgehogs, twenty-four species; Rodentia, rats and mice,
sixteen species; and Ungulata, one or two species of river-hog.
It will be seen that about two-fifths of the mammalian fauna
belong to the lemurs, and that with very few exceptions, all the
others are small and inconspicuous animals; many, however,
are of exceptional interest, as we shall see. From a consideration
of the facts regarding the mammals, as well as those of the
other forms of animal life found here—birds, reptiles and
insects—the following conclusions may be drawn: First,
Madagascar was anciently joined to Africa, receiving its fauna
from the continent, whose animal life was then much like that
of Madagascar at the present time; but it had also certain
connections at an early geological epoch with Asia and even
with South America, as there are undoubted affinities between
its fauna and those of these distant regions. Secondly,
this African connection of Madagascar existed before the
abundant animal life of the continent entered it from the north,
and when Africa was a great continental island—that is, its
central and southern portions, and separated from Europe and
Asia by a shallow sea, now the Sahara Desert. The upheaval
of that sea-bottom was probably to some extent contemporaneous
with the subsidence of the land which is now the
Mozambique Channel. Thirdly, Madagascar must have remained
for a long period separated from every other part of
the globe; and while the western and southern portions have
been repeatedly submerged, the highland interior, of palæozoic
rocks, is very ancient land, and much of its fauna is also antique
in its character.</p>

<p>But to leave this zoological dissertation and return to our
journey. I have not mentioned that more than once we saw
small companies of lemurs high over our heads, leaping with
wonderful agility from branch to branch, and uttering their
peculiar cry. These cries could often be heard when the
animals were not seen, and sounded almost like the cry of
children; and to myself there was always something pleasant
in it, as that of living creatures rejoicing in their freedom in
these boundless forests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BED OF A GREAT LAKE</div>

<p>On Saturday morning I wished Mr Plant good-bye and set off,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
leaving him at the village, which he was to make his head-quarters
for some time while collecting natural history specimens
in the forest. The road was not nearly so difficult as on the
previous day, so that I had no need to alight from the palanquin
all the way to Ampàsimpòtsy, where I stayed to breakfast.
The hills were much more moderate in height, with a good deal
of open clearing, although the forest still continued on either
hand, but not in those dense masses of wood through which we
had passed the last three or four days. Leaving our halting-place
at noon, we gradually got clear of the woods, and early in
the afternoon ascended a very high hill, from which we could
see a great distance both westward and eastward. Behind us
were the hills and valleys covered with forest through which
we had travelled, while in front stretched a great undulating
plain, bare and almost without a tree, except in a few places,
where there were large circular patches of wood. This was the
plain of Ankay, which separates the two belts of forest, and is
the home of the Bezànozàno tribe. Beyond this again, ten or
twelve miles away, was the upper forest, clothing the slopes and
summits of the edge of the interior highland. Careful examination
of this region has shown that it was formerly the bed of a
great lake, from two to three hundred miles long, extending
from the present Lake Alaotra, farther north, and is its gradually
diminishing remnant. Subsequent action of water has,
however, so cut up its former level that it now presents a very
uneven surface.</p>

<p>It was dull travelling alone after the pleasant companionship
of a fellow-traveller; and in making arrangements for meals,
etc., I felt how perfectly helpless a man is when he cannot
speak so as to be understood. I was a barbarian to my men,
and they were barbarians to me; for my stock of Malagasy
words was very limited, and probably almost unintelligible as to
pronunciation, so that I was at a complete standstill for nearly
everything I wanted to say. We reached Mòramànga, a rather
large village, at the commencement of the plain, soon after three
in the afternoon and there halted for the rest of the day. This
place was a military post of the Hova government, and on passing
through passports were examined by the officer in charge.</p>

<p>Next morning we were stirring early and left Mòramànga
while it was yet dusk. There was a thick mist, and my men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
were shivering with the cold, for we were now two thousand
nine hundred feet above the sea, and their scanty clothing was
but a poor protection. For an hour or two we saw little except
for a few yards around us; but as the sun rose the fog rolled
up like a vast curtain, revealing the line of the Ifòdy and Angàvo
hills straight before us; the slopes were partly covered with
trees, but a good deal of their surface was brown and bare.
In the deepest of the many valleys which cut the surface of the
Ankay plain runs a beautiful and rapid river, the Mangòro,
about one hundred and fifty feet wide where we crossed it in
canoes. This is the longest river of the east coast, and would
make a fine means of access to the interior, were its course not
interrupted by rapids and cataracts at many points.</p>

<p>Soon after crossing the river we commenced the ascent of
Ifòdy, a very steep and difficult path, for an hour or more; but
as we mounted higher and higher a glorious prospect gradually
revealed itself. Looking back after we had reached the summit,
there was the Mòramànga plain, bounded by the distant forest
stretching away north and south, until lost in the dim distance,
while below us the Mangòro could be seen in a wavy blue line
in the Ankay plain. Before us, to the left, was a lovely valley,
fertile and green with rice-fields, watered by the Valàla river and
shut in by the Angàvo range of mountains, while on the right
was a confused mass of hills, looking like a mighty sea which
had suddenly been hardened and fixed in its tossings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN EXTRAORDINARY NEST</div>

<p>There was much more evidence of cultivation as we proceeded,
the valleys being occupied by rice-fields, which were kept
covered with a few inches of water by careful irrigation. Among
the bird population of Madagascar there are some eighteen
species of herons and storks which are seen in the marshes and
rice-fields. One of the most noticeable of these is the <em>Tàkatra</em>
or tufted umber, a long-legged stork with a large plume or
crest. It builds an extraordinarily large nest, which is visible
at a considerable distance and might be taken at first sight for
half-a-load of hay. It is usually placed on the fork of a large
tree, and is composed of sticks and grass, plastered inside with
a thick lining of mud. It is from four and a half to six feet in
diameter, dome-shaped, with a lateral entrance, and is divided
into three chambers, in one of which its two large eggs are laid.
The entrance is by a narrow tunnel and is always placed so as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
to be difficult of access, though the nest itself may be quite easy
to approach. From this conspicuous nest, and the sedate way
in which the tàkatra marches about seeking for its food, many
native superstitions have gathered about the bird, one of which
is that those who destroy its nest will become lepers. If the
sovereign’s path was crossed by a tàkatra, it was considered
unlucky to proceed, and the royal procession had to retrace its
steps. Many native proverbs also refer to this bird. There are
also two other species of stork, one of which is always found
together with other shore birds; it lives in companies of from
six to twelve individuals at river-mouths, feeding on crustacea
and mulluscs, from which habit comes its name of <em>Famàkiakòra</em>
or “shell-breaker.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HOVAS</div>

<p>We were now nearing the country of the Hovas, and could see
an evident difference in the appearance of the inhabitants.
They were lighter in colour and had longer and straighter hair
than the coast tribes. But owing to the fashion, at that time,
of both sexes wearing their hair done up in a number of knots,
and from the apparent absence of whisker or beard, I was
sometimes puzzled to know at first sight whether the people we
passed were men or women; and there was little difference in
dress, the <em>làmba</em> being worn by both. Not only were the people
different in appearance to those we had mostly seen, but the
dwellings also had a much more civilised look. Several of the
houses at Ambòdinangàvo were of the true Hova type, with
high-pitched roofs, made of strong timber framing and filled in,
for the walls, with thick upright planking, instead of the slight
bamboos and leaves of the coast and forest houses. Some had
boarded floors and had a room in the roof; and the crossed
rafters at the gables were carried up for two or three feet above
the ridge. The house in which I stayed had a much more
comfortable appearance than any I had been in before, having
two rooms on the ground floor, the walls covered with matting,
and there were actually chairs! a luxury I had not experienced
since leaving Tamatave. I felt that I was getting near civilisation
again.</p>

<p>While dinner was preparing I strolled out into a ravine near
the house and was struck with the beauty and variety of the
insects, as indeed I had been in many parts of the journey.
There were butterflies of gorgeous hues, dragonflies, crimson,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
blue and dull gold in colour, grasshoppers with scarlet wings,
and the very spiders with gold and silver markings. Some
species of these latter were of great size; we saw hundreds of
them in their large geometric webs stretching over the paths as
we came along.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A COMBINATION OF BEAUTY</div>

<p>On Monday morning, 12th October, we left the village before
sunrise and immediately began the ascent of Angàvo, which
rises from fifteen hundred to sixteen hundred feet above the
valley. It is an enormous mass of granite, capped with clay,
the summit being scarped and fortified with earthworks; it is,
however, not a detached mountain rising from a plain on every
side, but rather a vast natural bastion or outwork of a higher
level of country. There was a gorgeous sunrise, which covered
the greater part of the sky with a crimson light, unlike anything
I had ever seen before. Then for another hour or two we were
passing through the upper belt of forest, here very narrow,
being only ten or twelve miles across, but as dense and as beautiful
as the lower and wider belt. And it was just as difficult
to travel through as the other forest, descending into the gorge
of the Mandràka river and then scaling the steep ascents. One
place especially, where we crossed the stream, was a perfect
combination of beauty—rushing waters, luxuriant foliage of
fern and palm and bamboo—and hundreds of large blue and
black papilio butterflies hovering over the river.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock we reached Ankèramadìnika, a village close
to the last ascent of the forest, and waited for a few minutes
while my bearers bought manioc root at the little market.
The people crowded round me, bringing various articles of food
for sale—sweet potatoes, honeycomb, and wild raspberries.
We had now left behind us the forest region and were on the bare
open uplands of Imèrina, the air being clear and keen. The
hills were less steep and more rounded, reminding me of some
parts of the English chalk downs, and there was hardly a tree
to be seen. In several places the granite or gneiss takes a dome-like
form; and in others the same rock formed the highest points.
For many miles I could see them rising high over every other
hill; one of these, on the southern side of a huge mountain
called Angàvokèly, was like a titanic castle; another, which is
divided into three and called Tèlomiràhavàvy (“Three Sisters”),
was like a vast church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">AMBÀTOMÀNGA</div>

<p>There were signs of approaching the capital in the number of
villages which came in sight. The country also was much more
cultivated, chiefly, however, in the valleys, where the bright
green patches of the newly sown rice gave a refreshing contrast
to the bare and brown appearance of the hills and downs, now
parched and dry after five or six months without rain. In
many places great black patches showed where the dry grass
had been set on fire. This is done shortly before the rains come
on, and the rank hay-like grass is succeeded by a crop of fine
short herbage suitable for pasture. About noon we caught sight
of the large village of Ambàtomànga, then two or three miles
distant. This place had an important and picturesque appearance,
being considerably larger than any town on the road.
Over a number of smaller dwellings one large house rose conspicuous,
with its lofty high-pitched roof and double verandah.
Close to the village is a lofty mass of blue gneiss rock, about a
couple of hundred feet in height, and crowned by a stone tomb
and other buildings, giving it the air of a fortification. Passing
through a large weekly market, where hundreds of people were
buying and selling, we at length entered the last station on the
road to Antanànarìvo.</p>

<p>Ambàtomànga had quite the appearance of a fortified town,
having walls of clay surrounding it, and deep fosses outside them.
I stopped at the large house which I had noticed at first, and
found it a well-finished timber structure, with venetian shutters
and framed doors, quite a contrast to the mere sheds in which
I had slept for ten nights past. It was divided into three rooms
on the ground floor, with walls, floor and ceiling all well
planed and finished. The owner, a fine-looking man and a native
noble, gave me a welcome in a little broken English; but his
knowledge of European tongues was apparently confined to
half-a-dozen short phrases, for he repeatedly said, “Thank you,
sir,” giving me a hearty shake of the hand at the same time,
as if he thought that was the proper formula to be observed.
A little before dusk I walked out with him to the fort-like tomb
on the top of the rock. In the light of the setting sun the red
clay hills gave back the warm rays with an intensity of colour
that was remarkable. The tomb at the top is a large stone
structure, well worked, with an open balustrade and bold mouldings.
Walking round the house after dusk, I saw a lurid glare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
in the sky on all sides, and then found it was produced by the
grass burning on the hills and downs, which showed in lines of
fire for many miles in all directions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRST VIEW OF THE CAPITAL</div>

<p>Early on Tuesday morning, with a glad heart I took my seat
in my palanquin, rejoiced to think that this was the last stage
in my long journey. About three-quarters of an hour after
leaving Ambàtomànga we caught our first sight of the capital,
still twelve or fourteen miles distant, and I could not but be
struck by its size and fine situation, a much larger city than I
had expected, built on the summit and slopes of a lofty rocky
hill some two miles long from north to south, which was covered
with dark-looking houses. In the centre stood conspicuous the
great bulk of the chief palace and its smaller neighbour, their
arched verandahs and steep roofs, all painted white, and shining
in the morning sun, towering over every other object. It was a
memorable moment to me, as I thought of what had happened
in Antanànarìvo within the last quarter-century, and that my
work was to raise lasting memorials to the brave Malagasy
who had suffered and died for their faith.</p>

<p>On we went over the long rolling moor-like hills, losing sight
of the city every now and then, and presently coming in view of
it again as we mounted the ridges; and every half-hour brought
out more of the details of the place and revealed its masses of
dark houses, clustered on the slopes of the rocky hill. Several
streams we crossed by means of stone arched bridges, and I was
struck by the number of villages to be seen in every direction,
many of them enclosed in high walls made of red clay, laid with
care in regular courses and apparently hard and durable. The
houses were all built of the same material, and many of them
were enclosed in circular and others in square courtyards with
gateways. Many of the villages were surrounded with deep
fosses, sometimes two and even three yards deep, now generally
filled with bananas, peach and other fruit trees, and some with
walls and stone gateways, giving one the impression that there
must have formerly been much internal warfare to need such
elaborate defences. This indeed was the case before Imèrina
was governed by one sovereign, about a hundred years ago.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOCUSTS</div>

<p>Within a mile or two of the city we passed for a quarter of an
hour through a perfect cloud of locusts, which covered the ground
and filled the air. At a distance these insects appeared like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
low-lying cloud of dust; and when near to one, and seen in
certain directions, the sun shining on their wings gave them
almost the appearance of a snow shower. I began to realise one
of the plagues of Egypt. Many varieties of locust are common
in Madagascar, and occasionally they do great damage to the
crops. The Malagasy, however, make use of them for food, and
when a cloud of them appears, men, women and children are all
out catching them; and for a few days afterwards great brown
heaps of them are to be seen at all the little wayside shops.
They are said to taste something like shrimps, without any
insides; but I must confess I never brought myself to taste
them, for they are anything but inviting in appearance.</p>

<p>At length I was carried into a compound near the foot of the
city hill, and after some delay was met by one of the L.M.S.
missionaries and conducted by a most difficult and breakneck
path up into the triangular central space called Andohàlo.
At the north-eastern corner of this space was the dispensary and
dwelling of our good medical missionary, Dr Davidson, from
whom and Mrs Davidson I received a hearty welcome, and in
a short time also from the rest of the missionary brethren.
With a glad and thankful heart I found myself in the capital of
Madagascar, with cheerful anticipations of being able to do
something in the service of Him who had protected me thus far,
and of helping in various ways the Malagasy people.</p>

<br />
<span class="fs70">THE CHANGING MONTHS IN IMÈRINA: CLIMATE, VEGETATION AND
LIVING CREATURES OF THE INTERIOR</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">MY object in these chapters is to describe, as vividly as
I am able, the varied aspects of the different months
throughout the year in this central province of Imèrina,
as they present themselves to anyone who lives in the capital
city of Antanànarìvo, and is frequently travelling in the country
around it. I want to show the variety of nature during the
changing seasons, as the result of the heat or cold, and of
the moisture or drought of the climate. And it must be
remembered that although this central province of Madagascar
is by several degrees well within the tropics, our climate for
some months of the year is by no means the “tropical”
one supposed in our ordinary English use of that word. On
these interior highlands, from three to five thousand feet
above the sea-level, the south-easterly winds blow from June
to August with a keenness and force which it needs thick
clothing to withstand, and makes a wood fire during the
long evenings a very pleasant addition to the comforts of
home life.</p>

<p>The seasons in the central regions of the island are practically
only two: the hot and rainy period, from the beginning of
November to the end of April; and the cool and dry period,
during the other months, from May to October. The Malagasy
are, however, accustomed to speak of four seasons of their year—viz.
the <em>Lòhataona</em>—<em>i.e.</em> “head of the year”—during September
and October, when the planting of the early rice is going on,
and a few showers give promise of the coming rains; the <em>Fàhavàratra</em>—<em>i.e.</em>
“thunder-time”—when severe storms of thunder
and lightning are frequent, with heavy downpours of rain, from
the early part of November to the end of February or into
March; the <em>Fàraràno</em>—<em>i.e.</em> “last rains”—from the beginning
of March and through April; and lastly, the <em>Rinìnina</em>—<em>i.e.</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
“time of bareness”—when the grass becomes dry and withered,
from June to August.</p>

<p>Taking therefore the seasons in order, from the beginning, not
of January, which gives no natural division of the year, but
from the early part of September, when the blossoms of the trees
speak of the “good time coming” of renewed verdure, I shall
note down, in their succession, the varying aspects of the
country, in climate, vegetation, and culture of the soil, as well
as the animal life, throughout the changing year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“THE HEART OF IMÈRINA”</div>

<p>Before, however, proceeding to do this, it may give greater
distinctness to the mental picture I want to draw for those who
have never been in Madagascar, if I try to describe in a few
words the appearance of this central province of the island,
especially of that portion of it which is in the neighbourhood of
the capital. From the usually pure and clear air of this elevated
region, which is not defiled by the smoke of chimneys, nor often
thickened by the mists of the lowlands, one can see for extraordinary
distances, and hills and rocks twenty or thirty miles
away stand out more sharp and distinct than they would usually
do in England at only four or five miles’ distance.</p>

<p>Let us go up to the highest point of the long rocky ridge on
and around which Antanànarìvo is built, from which we can
“view the landscape o’er,” and try and gain a clear notion of
this “heart of Imèrina,” as it is often called by the Malagasy.
The city hill reaches the greatest elevation at a point called
Ambòhimitsímbina—<em>i.e.</em> “Hill of regarding”—which is seven
hundred feet above the general level of the rice-plains around it.
From this “coign of vantage” there is of course a very extensive
view in every direction, and we see at once that the
surrounding country is very mountainous. East and south
there is little but hills of all shapes and sizes to be seen, except
along the valleys of the river Ikòpa and its tributaries, which
come from the edge of the upper forest, thirty miles or so away
to the east. To the north the country is more undulating, but
at ten or twelve miles away high hills and moors close in the
view, some of the hills rising into mountains. The country is
everywhere in these directions, except in the river valleys,
covered with red soil of various shades of colour, through which
the granite and gneiss foundations protrude at almost every
elevated point in huge boulder-like rocks, and form the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
summits of every hill and mountain, often in dome-shaped or
boss-like masses, and in some like titanic castles and towers.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Digging Up Rice-fields</span><br />

Notice the long-handled and long-bladed native spade, the handle serving
as a lever to turn over the clods</div>
</div>

<p>There is little foliage to be seen except on the top of some of
the hills where the ancient towns and villages are built, and in such
places a circle of old <em>àviàvy</em> trees and an occasional <em>amòntana</em>
tree give a pleasant relief to the prevailing red and ochre tints
of the soil, and, in the cold and dry season, to the russet and grey
hues of the dry grass on the bare hills and downs. The largest
mass of green is at the old capital, Ambòhimànga, eleven miles
away to the north, where the steep sides of the hill are still
covered with a remnant of the original forest, which formerly
was doubtless much more extensive in this part of the central
province. In the deep fosses which surround old villages there
is also often a considerable amount of foliage, as well as in the
hollows and along the streams. But it must be confessed that
a large extent of Imèrina, in common with the rest of the
interior, consists of bare rounded down-like hills, very uninteresting
in character; although towards sunset, in the slanting
rays, these hills have a softness of outline in their curves which
has a decided element of beauty not to be ignored.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GRANARY OF ANTANÀNARÌVO</div>

<p>To the west, from north to south, the prospect is very extensive.
To the south-west there rises by very gradual slopes, at
some thirty-five miles’ distance, the mass of Ankàratra, its
three or four highest peaks reaching an elevation of nearly
nine thousand feet above the sea, and about half that height
above the general level of the country. But even at such a
distance the summits usually stand out sharp and clear against
the sky. Due west and north-west is a considerable extent
of comparatively level country, beyond which mountains
fifty miles away are distinctly seen on the horizon. In the
foreground, stretching away many miles, is the great rice-plain
of Bétsimitàtatra, from which numbers of low red hills, most
of them with villages, rise like islands out of a green sea where
the rice is growing. Along the plain the river Ikòpa can be
seen, winding its way northwards to join the Bétsibòka; the
united streams, with many tributaries, flowing into the sea
through the Bay of Bèmbatòka. This great plain, “the
granary of Antanànarìvo,” was formerly an immense marsh,
and earlier still an extensive lake with numerous bays among
the surrounding hills; but since the embanking of the river by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
some of the early kings of Imèrina, it has become the finest rice-plain
of the island and, with its connected valleys, furnishes
the bulk of the food of the people of the central province.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DAMAGE BY STORMS</div>

<p>The embankments require, of course, constant attention
during the rainy season, when the river is swollen by the
heavy rains; and during the time of the native regime, an
unusually wet season would cause them to give way, so that the
rice-fields were flooded. At such times the whole population
would be called out to help in stopping the breaches, and I
remember one occasion, a Sunday, when we had no afternoon
service, and with others of my brother missionaries I spent
several hours in carrying sods and stones, together with our
people. Another such calamity occurred in January 1893;
for on the night of Saturday, the 28th, and the following day,
there was an unusually heavy storm, doing immense damage,
destroying hundreds of houses and village churches, and
breaking the river banks, so that in a day or two hundreds of
thousands of acres of the great rice-plain were under water,
three or four feet deep. In some parts it was difficult to trace
the river banks; it was “water, water everywhere,” and scores
of low hills were again turned into islands, cut off from all
communication, except by canoe, with the world around them.
If one could have forgotten the terrible loss to the people of their
crops of rice just ready to be cut, it was a most beautiful scene,
and reminded one that in ancient times this great plain was
always a lake, when many now extinct animals, reptiles and
gigantic birds found a home in it and on its shores. For
centuries the heavy rains—probably far heavier then than now,
from the greater extent of forest—went on filling up the valleys
with the rich black and blue loam; gradually the lake became
less and less deep; slowly the river cut out its bed; and then
man came on the scene, and the old native kings aided nature
by embanking the river; the marshes became rice-fields and
supplied with food the present large population which lives all
around it.</p>

<p>From this elevated point at least a hundred small towns and
villages can be recognised, many of them marked by the tiled
roof, and often the tower, of the village church, which shines
out distinctly amid the brown thatched roofs of most of the
houses. This view from the summit of the capital is certainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
an unrivalled one, in Madagascar at least, for its variety and
extent, as well as for the human interest of its different parts,
as shown by the large population, the great area of cultivated
land, the embanked rivers, and the streams and water-channels
for irrigation seen in every direction.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Springtime: September and October.</span>—With the early
days of September we may usually say that springtime in
Imèrina fairly sets in, and that the year in its natural aspects
properly commences. By a true instinct, arising doubtless
from long observation of the change of the seasons, the Malagasy
call this time <em>Lòhataona</em>—<em>i.e.</em> “the head, or beginning, of the
year”—when nature seems to awake from the comparative
deadness of the cold and dry winter months, during which the
country has looked bare and uninviting, but now begins again to
give promise of fertility and verdure. The keen cold winds and
drizzly showers of the past few weeks give place to warmer air
and clearer skies, and although usually there is but little rain
during September, the deciduous trees begin to put forth their
leaves, and flower-buds appear as heralds of the fuller display
of vegetable life which will be seen after the rains have
fallen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RICE-FIELDS</div>

<p>The great rice-plain to the west of Antanànarìvo still looks,
during the early days of the <em>Lòhataona</em>, bare and brown; but,
if we examine the prospect more closely, we shall see that in
various places, where the plain borders the low rising grounds
on which the villages are built, there are bright patches of vivid
green. These are the <em>kètsa</em> grounds or smaller rice-fields, where
the rice is first sown thick and broadcast, and where it grows
for a month or two before being planted out in the larger fields,
which are divided from each other by a low bank of earth, a few
inches broad and only a foot or two in height.</p>

<p>As the season advances, the people everywhere begin to be
busy digging up their rice-fields, both large and small, the clods
being piled up in heaps and rows in order to give the soil the
benefit of exposure to the sun and air. All this work is done by
the native long-handled and long and narrow bladed spade,
driven into the ground by the weight of the handle, as the
Malagasy wear no shoes and so could not drive down the spade
by the foot, in European fashion, while the plough is still an
unknown implement to them. The water-courses, by which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
water is brought to every rice-plot, are now being repaired in all
directions. The chief supply of water is from the springs found
at the head of almost every valley, which is carefully led by
channels cut and embanked round the curves of the hillsides,
being often taken thus for a considerable distance from its source.
Eventually this little canal resolves itself into a small stream
traversing the valley, from which smaller channels convey the
water to every field, so as to moisten the clods after they have
been dug over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WATER-SUPPLY</div>

<p>The water-supply for the great Bétsimitàtatra plain is
derived from the Ikòpa river and its many tributaries. Canals
tap these rivers at various points, in order to irrigate the fields
at lower levels farther down their course. A large quantity of
water is thus diverted from the rivers during September and
October, so that the smaller streams are almost dry, and even
the Ikòpa and its affluents, good-sized rivers at other times of
the year, then become shallow and easily fordable.</p>

<p>Before the end of October a large extent of the great plain,
especially to the north and north-west, is completely planted
with rice; and a green level, looking like one vast lawn, stretches
away for many miles in this direction, without any break or
visible divisions. This green is the <em>vàry alòha</em>, or “former
rice,” the first crop, which will become ripe in the month of
January, or early in February. Smaller expanses of bright
green appear in other directions also, especially along the
courses of the rivers, but a considerable extent of the plain
directly to the west of the capital is still russet-brown in colour,
and will not be planted until a month or two later. From this
will come the later rice-crop, the (<em>vàry</em>) <em>vàky ambiàty</em>, which is
planted in November or December and becomes fit for cutting
about April. This latter crop is so called because the flowering
of the <em>ambiàty</em> (<i>Vernonia appendiculata</i>) shrub, about November,
gives notice to the people that planting-time has come. This
shrub is very conspicuous about this time of the year from its
masses of white—slightly tinged with purple—flowers.</p>

<p>The <em>kètsa</em> grounds are covered before sowing with a layer of
wood and straw ashes, so that they have quite a black appearance.
Before this, however, the clods have been broken up and
worked by the spade into a soft mud, with an inch or two of
water over all, and on this the grain is sown broadcast, springing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
up in two or three weeks’ time and looking like a brilliant
emerald carpet.</p>

<p>There are usually a few heavy showers about the end of
September or the early part of October, which are called
<em>rànonòrana màmpisàra-taona</em>—<em>i.e.</em> “rain dividing the year”;
but occasionally no rain falls until the rainy season regularly
commences, so it is dry and dusty everywhere, the ground
cracks, and everything seems thirsting for moisture. The heat
increases as the sun gets more vertical, although the nights are
pleasantly cool. Yet notwithstanding the dry soil the trees
begin to blossom. Most conspicuous among them is the Cape
lilac (<i>Melia azederach</i>), a tree introduced from South Africa
about eighty or ninety years ago by the first L.M.S. missionaries,
and now thoroughly naturalised in the interior of Madagascar.
It grows to be a good-sized tree, and many hundreds
of them are to be seen in and around Antanànarìvo, making
the place gay with their profusion of pale greyish-lilac flowers,
and fragrant with their strong perfume.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORCHARDS</div>

<p>There are many large orchards in Imèrina, planted chiefly
with mango-trees and presenting a refreshing mass of evergreen
all the year round. But at this time, when looking from a
little distance, the green of the leaves is largely mingled with
a tinting of reddish-brown, caused by masses of flowers, in
spikes, chiefly in the upper part of the trees. Later on the
purplish tint of the new leaves gives another shade of colour.
The produce of these trees is an excellent fruit; and there are
three or four varieties of it, one kind, “the stone mango,” being
more globular in shape; another, “the satin-mango,” being
smaller, like a large plum, with a delicate flavour and scent.
Another most widely grown fruit is the peach, which is more
used cooked than eaten raw; and others are the <em>bìbàsy</em> or
loquat, the quince, the rose-apple, the orange, and the <em>ròtra</em>, a
good-sized tree with a profusion of small black pear-shaped
fruits, somewhat astringent when eaten raw, but excellent for
cooking and for preserves. The vine also is largely cultivated,
chiefly a black variety; while bananas and plantains and pine-apples
are to be had all the year through.</p>

<p>The low banks of earth which form the boundary walls of
plantations are largely planted with a species of <i>Euphorbia</i>, of
which there are two varieties, one with brilliant scarlet bracts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
and the other of pale yellow tint, the leaves appearing on the
prickly stems later on.</p>

<p>As the season advances the people burn the grass over the
hillsides and open moors, as we saw at Ambàtomànga when
coming up the country. There can be no doubt that to this
practice is largely attributable the bare and treeless appearance
of the central provinces. The young trees which would spring
up, especially in the hollows and sheltered places, have no
chance against the yearly fires which sweep over the country,
and the little vegetation which has held its own is constantly
liable to be lessened as time goes on. Sometimes a dozen fires,
long curving lines of flame, may be seen at once in different
directions, and these give a strangely picturesque appearance
to the nights of springtime in Imèrina.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BIRDS</div>

<p>The weather often becomes very hot and sultry before the
rains come on, and the usually bright clear skies and pure
atmosphere of other months are exchanged for thick oppressive
days, when the distant hills disappear altogether, and the
nearer ones seem quite distant in the dense haze. This is
probably due, to a great extent, to the grass-burning just
described, and also to the frequent burning of the forest away
to the east. As the weather gets warmer a few birds come up
from the wooded regions of the country, and wherever there is
a small patch of wood the oft-repeated cry of the <em>Kankàfotra</em>,
the Madagascar cuckoo, may be heard, much resembling the
syllables “<em>kow-kow, kow-kow-koo</em>.”</p>

<p>And here we must notice more fully the birds to be seen in
Imèrina. They are few compared with those in the warmer
and forest regions, and are mostly of powerful flight, principally
birds of prey, swifts, swallows and water-birds. The two
coast regions—east and west—are, on the contrary, well
peopled with birds of all sorts, and while the greater part of
these inhabit indifferently one or the other region, there are a
certain number which have their habitat almost exclusively in
one region only, and give it its special characteristics. There
are also some which keep to a still more limited area, not going
beyond a very restricted range. As far as is at present known,
two hundred and ten species of birds have been found in Madagascar;
and the very special character of its avi-fauna may be
seen from the fact that it includes forty-one genera and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
hundred and twenty-four species, which are all peculiar to the
island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RAPACIOUS BIRDS</div>

<p>The rapacious birds of the country comprise twenty-two
species, the majority being hawks, kites and buzzards, with
several owls and two eagles. The most common bird of this
order is the <em>Papàngo</em> or Egyptian kite, a large hawk found all
over the island. It may be seen every day flying gracefully
along in search of lizards and snakes, and the mice, rats and
small birds which form its chief food, and continually swooping
down upon its prey. When the long dry grass is being burned
on the downs the papàngo may be noticed sweeping backwards
and forwards close to the edge of the blazing grass, so as to pick
up the smaller creatures escaping the advancing flames, or those
which have been overtaken by them and killed. I have
occasionally observed hundreds of these birds in the neighbourhood
of Ambòhimànga, describing great circles, at an immense
height, and have wondered how such large numbers could
obtain food. This kite is the dread of the country-dwelling
Malagasy, for it swoops down on their chickens and is only
scared away by their loud cries and execrations. From these
habits comes one of its provincial names, <em>Tsimalàho</em>—<em>i.e.</em> “the
one who does not ask,” but takes without saying “by your
leave.” It is constantly seen in company with the white-necked
crows, and, like them, feeds near the villages, especially
near where the oxen are killed.</p>

<p>Another very widely spread rapacious bird is the little lively
and noisy <em>Hìtsikìtsika</em> or kestrel, which is found in or about
every village, often perched on the gable “horns” of the
houses, or even on the extreme point of the lightning conductors.
It is by no means shy, and one can sometimes approach it quite
closely and see its bright fearless eyes, before it darts away. It
is fond of the same resting-place and, after a noisy chatter with
its mate, takes a sweeping flight for a few hundred yards and
returns to its former condition. Several native proverbs refer
to the kestrel’s quick restless flight and its frequent habit of
hovering aloft, poised almost motionless, or with an occasional
quivering of the wings, which, in Malagasy idiom, is called
“dancing,” for the native dances consist as much in a graceful
motion of the hands as in that of the feet. Among some tribes,
or families, the kestrel is a tabooed bird and it is crime to kill it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">HAWKS</div>

<p>Another hawk worth noticing, although much less common
than the two previously mentioned ones, is the lesser falcon, a
small but very courageous bird, which has long attracted the
attention of the Malagasy for its swiftness. The native name,
<em>Vòromahèry</em>, or “Powerful bird,” is also that of the tribe of
Hova Malagasy who inhabit the capital and its near neighbourhood,
and this falcon also was adopted as a crest or emblem
by the native government, and its figure was engraved on their
official seals. Its flight is extremely rapid, more like that of an
arrow than that of a bird.</p>

<p>Many of the Malagasy hawks are beautiful birds, with
horizontal bars of alternate light and dark colour on breast and
tail; but perhaps the most handsome of them all is the Rayed
Gymnogene, which is of a pearly-grey colour, barred with black,
while on the tail and quill feathers are broad bands of pure
white and intensely glossy black. This bird stands high, having
very long legs, with a crest of feathers on the crown and neck.</p>

<p>As the end of October draws near the people are busily at
work, not only in the rice-fields, but also repairing their houses,
mending their grass or rush roofs, and hurrying on their sun-dried
brick or clay building before the heavy rains fall. The
majority of native houses are of those materials, and everything
must be finished, or at least well protected from the weather,
before the rainy season comes on. The water-courses, too, need
attention, and the river banks must be repaired, lest a succession
of heavy rains should swell the streams, break through the
embankments and flood the rice-plains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Summer: November, December, January and February.</span>—Summer
in central Madagascar is not only the hot season, but
it is also the rainy season, very little rain falling at any other
time of the year. It is accordingly called by the Malagasy
<em>Fàhavàratra</em>—<em>i.e.</em> “thunder-time”—since almost all heavy rain
is accompanied by a thunderstorm; and taking the average of
a good many years, this season may be said to commence at the
beginning of November.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A TROPICAL STORM</div>

<p>As the sun gets every day more nearly vertical at noon, on
his passage towards the southern tropic, the heat increases, and
the electric tension of the air becomes more oppressive. For a
week or more previous to the actual commencement of the rains,
the clouds gather towards evening, and the heavens are lighted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
up at night by constant flashes of lightning. But at length,
after a few days of this sultry weather, towards midday the
huge cumuli gather thickly over the sky and gradually unite
into a dense mass, purple-black in colour, and soon the thunder
is heard. It rapidly approaches nearer and nearer, the clouds
touching the lower hills, then down darts the forked lightning,
followed by the roar of the thunder, and presently a wild rush
of wind, as if it came from all quarters at once, tells us that the
storm is upon us, and then comes the rain, in big heavy drops
for a few seconds and soon in torrents, as if the sluice-gates of
the clouds were opened. The lightning is almost incessant;
now and then, in one of the nearer crashes, it is as if the whole
artillery of heaven were playing upon the doomed earth; and
for half-an-hour or so there is often hardly any interval between
the crashing and reverberations of the thunder peals, the hills
around the capital echoing back the roar from the clouds.
Certainly a heavy thunderstorm in Madagascar is an awfully
grand and glorious spectacle and is not without a considerable
element of danger too, especially for anyone caught in the
storm in the open, or in a house unprotected by a lightning-conductor.
Every house of any pretensions in the central
provinces has this safeguard, for every year many people are
killed by lightning, some while walking on the road, and others
in houses unprotected by a conductor. One often hears of
strange freaks, so to speak, played by the lightning; for
instance, one of our college students, travelling with wife and
children to the Bétsiléo, was killed instantaneously, as well as
a slave near him, when sitting in a native house, while a child
he was nursing at the time escaped with a few burns only. A
missionary of the Norwegian Society was struck by lightning,
which melted the watch in his pocket, drove the nails out of his
shoes, and yet he escaped with no other harm than some burns,
which eventually healed.</p>

<p>A large quantity of rain sometimes falls during such storms
in a very short time. On one occasion three and a quarter
inches fell in less than half-an-hour; and as the streets and
paths through the capital were formerly all very steep, and there
was no underground drainage, it may be imagined what a roar of
water there was all over the city after such a storm. The three
or four chief thoroughfares were transformed into the beds of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
rushing torrents and a series of cascades; from every compound
spouted out a jet of water to join the main stream, and it used
to be no easy matter to get about at all in the rush and the roar.
It was no wonder that most of the highways of the capital got
deeper and deeper every year. Even where there was an
attempt at a rough paving, a single storm would often tear it up
and pile the stones together in a big hole, with no more order
than obtains in the bed of a cataract. After the rains were over,
the red soil was dug away from the sides to fill up the channel
cut by the torrent, and so the road gradually sank below the
walls of the compounds on either side of it.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">RAINFALL</div>

<p>The annual rainfall of Antanànarìvo is about fifty inches,
December and January being the wettest months, with an
average fall of ten to twelve inches each. It is very unusual
for thunderstorms to occur in the morning, they mostly come
on in the afternoon; and after the first heavy downpour a
steady rain will often continue for three or four hours, and
occasionally far into the night. It is generally bright and fine
in the early morning; all vegetation is refreshed by the plentiful
moisture; and the people are busy in their plantations on the
sloping hillsides, digging up the softened earth for planting
manioc, sweet potatoes, the edible arum, and many other
vegetables.</p>

<p>Hail also very frequently falls during these thunderstorms;
and should it be late in the season, when the rice is in ear, great
damage is often done to the growing crop. A large extent of
rice-field will sometimes be stripped of every grain, the stalks
standing up like bare sticks. Charms against hail had therefore
in the old heathen times a prominent place in the popular
beliefs and, there can be little doubt, are still trusted in and
used by many of the more ignorant people. Occasionally
the hailstones are of very large size and kill sheep and small
animals, if they are left unsheltered. I remember a storm of
this kind, when the hailstones were as large as good-sized nuts,
while some were cushion-shaped and hexagonal, with a
hollow in the centre, and nearly one and a half inches in
diameter. In other cases they have been seen as jagged
lumps of ice; and it may be easily imagined that it is very
unpleasant and somewhat dangerous to be exposed to such a
fusillade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">LIGHTNING</div>

<p>Besides the thunderstorms like those just described, which
come so close and are often so awful in their results, there is
another kind of storm we frequently see in the rainy season
which is an unmixed source of delight. This is when, for two
or three hours together in the evening, a large portion of the
sky is lighted up by an almost incessant shimmer of lightning,
now revealing glimpses of a glory as if heaven itself were
opening, and anon showing many different tiers and strata of
clouds lying one behind the other, and alternately lighted up,
making clear the outlines of the nearer masses of cumulus upon
the brilliant background. How wonderful are the different
colours of this lightning! intense white, like glowing metal,
now red, and now violet; and not less wonderful are its forms!
now it is a zigzag, which plunges downwards, now it branches
out horizontally, and again it darts upwards into the clouds;
and then, for a few moments, there is nothing but an incessant
quiver and shimmer, which lights up first one quarter of the
heavens, and then another, and then the whole. All the time
no thunder is heard from this celestial display, but it is most
fascinating to watch the infinitely varied effects of light and
darkness, till we sometimes feel as if a “door was opened in
heaven,” and we could catch a glimpse of “the excellent
glory” within.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OLD STYLE DIVISION OF TIME</div>

<p>Something may be said here about the native division of
time. Although the European months and year have become
generally known and used, the old style of months are still
recognised to some extent by the Malagasy. Their months
were lunar ones, and therefore their year was eleven days shorter
than ours, their New Year’s Day coming consequently at
different times, from the first to the twelfth month, until the
cycle was complete after thirty-three years. When I first
came to Madagascar the Malagasy New Year began in the
month of March; and this style of reckoning time was kept up
until the accession of the last native sovereign, Queen Rànavàlona
III., in 1883. The Malagasy appear never to have
made any attempt, by the insertion of intercalary days or any
other contrivance, to fill up their shorter year to the true time
occupied in the earth’s annual revolution round the sun; for
of course they must have noticed that their New Year came at
quite different periods after a few years. The names of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
Malagasy months are all Arabic in origin, as indeed are also the
days of the week (Alahàdy (Sunday), Alàtsinainy (Monday),
Talàta (Tuesday), Alarobìa (Wednesday), etc.); but it is curious
that the month names are not the Arabic names of the months,
but are those of the constellations of the Zodiac. Thus, Alàhamàdy
is the Ram, Adaoro is the Bull (<em>daoro</em> = <em>taurus</em>),
Adizaoza is the Twins, and so on. This appears to have arisen
from the connection between astrology and the divination
(<em>sikìdy</em>) introduced by the Arabs several centuries ago.</p>

<p>The New Year was <em>the</em> great festival of the Malagasy and was
observed on the first day of the first month, Alàhamàdy. It
was called the <em>Fandròana</em> or “Bathing,” and was kept up until
the French conquest in 1895, but since then has been superseded
by the Fête of the French Republic on 14th July every
year. The ancient customs were, however, very interesting,
and were chiefly the following:—(1) The lighting of little
bundles of dried grass at dusk on the evenings of the last day of
the old year and the first of the new one. These fires, possibly
a relic of the old fire-worship, were called <em>harèndrina</em>, and
formed one of the most pleasing features of the festival in the
gathering darkness of the evening. (2) The ceremonial Royal
Bathing at the great palace, when all the principal people of the
kingdom were present, as well as representative foreigners, was
the most prominent of all the ceremonies, giving, as it did, the
name to the whole festival. At a fixed time in the evening the
queen retired behind curtains fixed at the north-east (the
sacred corner) of the great hall and bathed in a silver bath; after
which she emerged, robed and crowned, and, carrying a horn
of water in her hands, went down the assembly to the door,
sprinkling the people as she passed. (She would playfully give
some of us an extra splash as she went along.) (3) On the
following day came the killing of oxen, doubtless the most
important of all the observances in the estimation of the people
generally, at any rate of the poorer classes, who then got, for
once a year at least, a plentiful supply of beef. Presents of the
newly killed meat were sent about in all directions to relatives
and friends, and feasting and merry-making prevailed for
several days among all classes. (4) For some time previous to
the actual festival it was customary for the Malagasy to visit
their elders and superiors in rank, bringing presents of money,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
fowls, fruit, etc., using certain complimentary formulæ and
expressions of good wishes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WILD FLOWERS</div>

<p>The rains which usually fall in November soon make the hills
and downs, which have got so brown and dry during the cold
season, become green again. Especially does the fresh grass
brighten those portions of the hillsides where the withered grass
and fern had been burnt two or three months before; and
although, as already noticed, wild flowers are not so plentiful
or prominent in Madagascar as they are in European countries,
there are several kinds which now make their appearance and
give some beauty to the scene. Among these are the <em>vònènina</em>
(<i>Vinca rosea</i>), with large pink flowers; the <em>avòko</em> (<i>Vigna angivensis</i>),
bright crimson; the <em>nìfinakànga</em> (<i>Commelyna madagascarica</i>),
deep blue; several small vetch-like plants with yellow
flowers; many others with minute yellow compound flowers,
and some few other kinds. A beautiful scarlet gladiolus is
seen sparingly on the downs, as well as a conspicuous and
handsome white flower, with a long tubular calyx, very like a
petunia.</p>


<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> It will be understood that all this refers to Antanànarìvo

been wonderfully improved; well paved and drained streets
have been engineered all over the place, with electric lighting

<span class="fs70">SPRING AND SUMMER</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">BESIDES flowers growing on the ground, there are many
shrubs and small trees now in blossom, although some
are by no means confined in floral display to the warm
and rainy season. Along the hedges in some localities is a
small bush, with clusters of purple leguminous flowers, called
<em>famàmo</em> (<i>Mundulea suberosa</i>); branches of these shrubs are
sometimes placed in a pool or stream, so as to stupefy, and thus
easily obtain, any fish present in the water. Very conspicuous
are the bright yellow flowers of the <em>tainakòho</em> (<i>Cassia lævigata</i>),
and the <em>tsiàfakòmby</em> (<i>Cæsalpinia sepiaria</i>), and the orange-yellow
spikes of the <em>sèva</em> (<i>Buddleia madagascariensis</i>). More
showy and handsome still perhaps are the abundant large
yellow flowers of the prickly pear, which is so largely used for
hedges and for the defences of the old towns and villages. The
strong and sharp spines, from an inch to an inch and a half long,
are the usual native substitute for pins. A species of <i>Hibiscus</i>
(<i>Hibiscus diversifolius</i>) is not uncommon, with yellow flowers,
which have deep red in the centre; yellow seems indeed the
most common colour in the flora of Imèrina. At this time of the
year also three or four species of aloe come into flower. The
larger of these, called <em>vàhona</em> (<i>Aloe macroclada</i>) by the Malagasy,
is much used for planting as a hedge, from its fleshy leaves being
armed with sharp prickles; its tall flower spike shoots up very
rapidly to a height of four or six feet. Another and smaller
one, called <em>sahòndra</em> (<i>Aloe capitata</i>), has its flowers branching
at the top of the stalk something like a candelabra. The
numerous flowers attract, as they expand, swarms of bees.
Another plant, like an aloe in appearance, called <em>tarètra</em>
(<i>Fourcroya gigantea</i>) by the natives, has long leaves, with a
sharp spine at the ends only; and its flower-stalk shoots up
like a small mast to a height of twenty feet, with widely
spreading branchlets and an immense number of light coloured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
flowers. Strong fibre used as thread is obtained from the
leaves, the name of the plant being indeed that used for
“thread.” The tall flower-stalks of these aloes and agaves
form quite a noticeable feature in the Imèrina landscape in the
early summer. In the orchards, soon after the mango has
finished flowering, we may see the curious whitish flowers of the
rose-apple, a sort of ball of long stamens, showing conspicuously
among the foliage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WATER-PRODUCING INSECTS</div>

<p>It is well known by those who live in Madagascar that there
are, at certain seasons of the year, a number of insects found
on trees which produce a constant dropping of water. Happening
one day to be standing under a peach-tree in our garden
from which water was dropping, I found that there were
clusters of insects on some of the smaller branches. In each
cluster there were about twenty to thirty insects, and these were
partly covered with froth, from which the water came. The
insects producing this appeared at first sight to be small beetles,
about half-an-inch long, black in colour, with golden-yellow
markings on the head and thorax, while on the wing-cases there
was a chequer of minute spots of yellow on the black ground.
After observing a single insect for a few seconds, I noticed that
the tail was quite flexible and moved sideways, and was constantly
protruded and then withdrawn a little, and it was
evident that these little creatures were the larval form of a
species of beetle. The sap of the tree is extracted in such
quantities as to maintain their bodies in a state of saturated
humidity. The activity of the larvæ seems to increase as the
heat of the day progresses, and to diminish again towards
evening. But the object of this abstraction of fluid from the
tree, and the purpose it serves, is still a subject needing investigation.
I have observed these insects on other trees—mangoes,
acacia, <em>zàhana</em>, and others; they appear indeed to be very
common, and the ground underneath the branches where they
cluster is covered with small patches soaked with water. A
French naturalist, M. Goudot, described an insect apparently
of the same kind as that found in Imèrina as the larva of a
species of <i>Cercopis</i>, and nearly related to the cicada of Europe.
The quantity of water produced from a tree at Tamatave seems
to have been much greater than that observed in the interior,
and resembling a small rain-shower; probably this was due to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
the greater heat of the coast. M. Goudot says that the perfect
insect attains a length of an inch and a half, and that these also
emit small drops of clear and limpid water.</p>

<p>Towards the beginning of December the earlier crop of rice
comes into ear; and should the rains fall as usual during
November, the remaining portions of the great rice-plain will be
all planted out with the later crop, the whole of the level and its
branching valleys presenting an unbroken expanse of green.
Of this, the early rice shows distinctly as a darker shade of
colour, although it will soon begin to turn yellow, as the grain
ripens under the steady heat and the plentiful rainfall. Perhaps
this is the time when Bétsimitàtatra is seen in its most attractive
and beautiful aspect, for every part of it is covered with rice in
some stage or other of growth and cultivation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DAYS AND NIGHTS</div>

<p>To anyone coming for the first time into a tropical country
from England, the comparative uniformity in the length of the
days and nights throughout the year seems very strange. In
Imèrina there is only about two hours’ difference in the length
of the longest day, about Christmas, and the shortest day, early
in July. It is dark at about seven o’clock on the first of
January, and at about six o’clock on the first of July. Thus
we have no long evenings, which are such a delight in the
summer months in England; but, on the other hand, we escape
the long nights and the short gloomy days of the English winter.
We lose also the long twilights of the temperate zone, although
I have never seen the almost instantaneous darkness following
sunset which one sometimes reads about. There is a twilight
of from fifteen to twenty minutes’ duration in this part of Madagascar.
While, therefore, we miss the much greater variety of
the seasons in England, we have many compensations, especially
in the very much larger proportion of bright sunny days,
the clear skies, and the pure atmosphere of our Imèrina climate.
Very seldom have we a wet morning in any part of the year; and
the heat is not more oppressive than it is in hot summers in
England, while in the cold season the sharp keen air is bracing
and health-giving. We never see snow in Madagascar, but a
thin film of ice is very occasionally seen on the slopes of the
Ankàratra mountains in July and August.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HOURS</div>

<p>It may be interesting to notice at this point the numerous
words used by the Malagasy to indicate the different times of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
the day, from morning to evening. Clocks and watches are
comparatively a recent introduction into Madagascar, nor do
the people ever seem to have contrived any kind of sun-dial,
although, as will be seen, they did use something else as a kind
of substitute for such a time-keeper. It should be remembered
that the hours given (counting in European fashion) as equivalents
for these native divisions of the night and the day are
only approximations, and must be taken as the <em>mean</em> of the year,
or, in other words, at about the time of equal day and night,
towards the end of March or of September. They are as

<p>This list is, I think, a very interesting one, and shows the
primitive pastoral and agricultural habits of the Hova Malagasy
before they were influenced by European civilisation. Previous
to their knowledge of clocks and watches (which are still unknown
to the majority of people away from the capital), the
native houses thus served as a rude kind of dial. As, until
recent times, these were always built with their length running
north and south, and with the single door and window facing
the west, the sunlight coming in after midday at the open
door gave, by its gradual progress along the floor, a fairly
accurate measure of time to people amongst whom time was not
of very much account. In the forenoon, the position of the sun,
nearly square with the eastern purlin of the roof, marked about
nine o’clock; and as noon approached, its vertical position,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
about the ridge-pole, or at least its reaching the meridian,
clearly showed twelve o’clock. Then, as the sunlight gradually
passed westward and began to peer in at the door, at about one
o’clock, it announced “the peeping-in of the day” (<em>mitsìdika
àndro</em>); and then, as successive points on the floor were reached
by the advancing rays, several of the hours of the afternoon
were sufficiently clearly marked off: “the place of rice-pounding”
(<em>am-pitotòam-bàry</em>), as the light fell on the rice mortar,
further into the house; “the calf-fastening place”
(<em>am-pamatòran-jànak òmby</em>), as the rays reached one of the
three central posts supporting the ridge, and where the calf
was fastened for the night; and then, “touching” (<em>tàfapàka</em>),
when the declining sunshine reached the eastern wall, at about
half-past four in the afternoon. Other words and notes of time,
it will be seen, are derived from various natural phenomena.
Some other words for the division of time used by the Malagasy
may be here noted. Thus “a rice-cooking” (<em>indray màhamàsa-bàry</em>)
is frequently used to denote about half-an-hour; while
“the frying of a locust” (<em>indray mitòna valàla</em>) is a phrase
employed to describe a moment.</p>

<p>Many words exist in the Malagasy language to denote different
appearances of nature which are somewhat poetical and seem
to show some imaginative power. Thus the light fleecy clouds
in the upper regions of the atmosphere are called “sky
gossamer” (<em>faròran-dànitra</em>); the sun is the “day’s-eye”
(<em>masoandro</em>); the galaxy is the “dividing of the year” (<em>èfi-taona</em>);
the rainbow is “God’s great knife” (<em>àntsibèn’ Andrìamànitra</em>);
and a waterspout is the “tail of the sky” (<em>ràmbon-dànitra</em>).</p>

<p>We saw just now that in Imèrina the native houses, with the
sun touching different parts of them, form a kind of primitive
sun-dial; so it may be well here to say something about the
structure and arrangement of a native house in this part of
Madagascar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HOVA HOUSE</div>

<p>A Hova house of the old style is always built with its length
running north and south; it is an oblong, the length being
about half as much again as the breadth, and the door and
window always on the west side, so as to be sheltered from the
prevailing south-east winds; for, as there is no glass, there
would be much inconvenience in facing the windward side.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
There is frequently another window at the north end of the
house, and often one also in the north gable. The material
used always to be the hard red clay found all over the central
provinces; and this is still largely used, although sun-dried
bricks are supplanting the old style of building. This clay,
after being mixed with water, is kneaded by being trampled over
thoroughly, and is then laid in courses of about a foot to eighteen
inches in height, and about the same in thickness. Each layer
is allowed to become hard and firm before the next one is set,
and it is well beaten on both sides as it dries. If properly laid
and of good material, the cracks are not very large when the
clay is dry, and are filled up; and it makes a very substantial
and durable walling, quite as much, and more so, as the majority
of cheap brick houses in England. The boundary walls of the
compounds are also made of the same hard clay; and it is
remarkable how many years such material will last without
much damage, although exposed almost daily, for four or five
months every year, to the heavy rains of the wet season. (I
know walls which had been built for several years before I
saw them first forty-three years ago, and yet they seem little
altered since that time.)</p>

<p>The houses of the upper classes and richer people used to be
built of timber framework, the walls being of thick upright
planks, which are grooved at the edge, a tenon of the tough
<em>anìvona</em> palm bark being inserted so as to hold them together.
Two or three lengths of the same fibrous substance were also
passed through each plank longitudinally at different heights
from the ground, so as to bind them all firmly together round
the house. The accompanying drawing will show more clearly
than any verbal description the details of the structure of a
Hova <em>tràno-kòtona</em>, as this style of wooden house is called (no
such houses are built nowadays; and very few of them
remain; the use of brick, sun-dried and burnt, has entirely
superseded them). The roof in both clay and timber houses
does not depend for its stability on the walls only, but is mainly
supported by three tall posts, which are let into the ground for
some depth and carry the ridge-piece. One of these posts is in
the centre, and one is at each end, close to the walls inside the
house. This is a wise provision, as the roofs are generally of high
pitch, and in violent winds would need much more support than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
could be given by the walls. The gables were always thatched
with the same materials as the roof, either of long grass or the
<em>hèrana</em> sedge. At each gable the outer timbers cross the apex,
and project upwards for about a foot or two, the extremities
being notched, and often having a small wooden figure of a
bird. In the houses of people of rank, the <em>tàndro-tràno</em> or
“house-horns” were three or four feet long, while in some of
the royal houses they projected ten or twelve feet, the length
being apparently some indication of the rank of the owner. In
some tribes these gable ornaments, which have become only
conventional horns among the Hovas, are carved in exact
resemblance of those adorning the head of a bullock.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE INTERIOR</div>

<p>The interior arrangements of a Hova house are very simple
and are (or perhaps it would be more correct to say <em>were</em>)
almost always the same.</p>

<p>Let us, following Malagasy politeness, call out before we
enter, “<em>Haody, haody?</em>” equivalent to, “May we come in?”
And while we wait a minute or two, during which the mistress
of the house is reaching down a clean mat for us to sit down on,
we notice that the threshold is raised a foot or more above the
ground on either side, sometimes more, so that a stone is placed
as a step inside and out. Entering the house in response to the
hospitable welcome, “<em>Màndrosòa, Tòmpoko é</em>,” “Walk forward,
sir” (or madam), we step over the raised threshold. In some
parts of Imèrina a kind of closet, looking more like a large oven
than anything else, is made of clay at the south-east corner,
opposite the door, and here, as in an Irish cabin, the pig finds
a place at night, and above it the fowls roost. Near the door
the large wooden mortar or <em>laona</em> for pounding rice generally
stands, and near it are the <em>fanòto</em> or pestle, a long round piece of
wood, and the <em>sahàfa</em> or large shallow wooden dish in which the
rice is winnowed from husk removed by pounding. At about
the middle of the eastern side of the house are placed two or
three globular <em>sìny</em> or water-pots, the mouths covered with a
small basket to keep out the dust. Farther on, but near the
west side, is the <em>fàtana</em> or hearth, a small enclosure about three
feet square. In this are fixed five stones, on which the rice-cooking
pots are arranged over the fire. And over this is sometimes
fixed a light framework upon which the cooking-pots are
placed when not in use. There is no chimney, the smoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
finding its way out through windows or door or slowly through
the rush or grass thatch, and so the house is generally black and
sooty above, long strings of cobweb and soot hanging down
from the roof. Such appendages were considered as marks of
long residence and honour, and so the phrase, <em>mainty molàly</em>,
<em>lit.</em> “black from soot,” is a very honourable appellation, and is
applied to things ancient, such as the first Christian hymns;
and missionaries who have been a long time resident in the
island are given this name as a mark of respect.</p>

<p>The north-east corner of the house is the sacred portion of it,
and is called <em>zòro firaràzana</em>—<em>i.e.</em> the corner where the <em>ràry</em> or
war-chant was sung and where any religious act connected
with the former idolatry was performed, and in which the
<em>sàmpy</em> or household charm was kept in a basket suspended
from the wall. In this corner also is the fixed bedstead, which,
especially in royal houses, was often raised up some height
above the ground and reached by a notched post serving as
a ladder, and sometimes screened with mats or coarse cloth.
West of this, close to the north roof-post, is the place of honour,
<em>avàra-pàtana</em>, “north of the hearth,” where guests are invited
to sit down, a clean mat being spread as a seat, just as a chair is
handed in European houses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FURNITURE</div>

<p>There is little furniture in a purely native house; a few rolls
of mats, half-a-dozen spoons in a small but long basket fixed to
the wall, some large round baskets with covers, and perhaps a
tin box containing <em>làmbas</em> for Sunday and special occasions;
a few common dishes of native pottery, and perhaps two or
three of European make; a horn or a tin <em>zìnga</em>, for drinking
water; a spade or two—these with the rice mortar and pounder
and winnower already mentioned—the water-pots, and the
implements for spinning <ins class="corr" id="tn-98" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'and wearing'">
and weaving</ins>, constitute about the
whole household goods in the dwellings of the poorer classes.
The earthen floor is covered with coarse mats, and sometimes
the walls are lined with finer mats; in the roof an attic is often
formed for a part of or the whole length of the house and is
reached by a rude ladder. The floor of this upper chamber is
frequently covered over with a layer of earth and is used as a
cooking-place, with much advantage to the lower part of the
house, which is thus kept comparatively free from smoke and
soot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>It must be understood the foregoing description applies to
the original style of native house, as unaffected by modern
innovations. In the capital and the more important places, as
well as in many villages, numbers of brick houses, with upper
storeys and three or four or more rooms, have been built of late
years; and hundreds of six-roomed houses, with verandahs
carried on brick pillars, have also been erected, following a
model introduced about the year 1870 by the late Rev. J.
Pearse. This struck the fancy of the well-to-do people, and
similar ones have been built all over the central provinces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEST OF BLACK WASP</div>

<p>Few people who have lived in Madagascar can have failed to
notice a small longish lump of light coloured clay stuck under
the eaves of the house, or on the side of a window, or, in fact,
in any sheltered place; and if we take the trouble to break off
a piece, we find that this lump of clay contains a number of
cells, all filled with caterpillars or spiders in a numbed and semi-lifeless
condition. The maker of these cells is a black wasp
about an inch long, with russet wings, and as one sits in the
verandah of one’s house one may often hear a shrill buzz
somewhere up in the rafters, and there the little worker is busy
bringing in pellets of clay with which she builds up the walls of
the cell. (When I lived at Ambòhimànga, one of these wasps
made a nest with several cells in my study, as the window was
generally open to the air.) Presently she is off again for
another load to the banks of a little stream where she has her
brick-field. Kneading the red earth with her mandibles, she
quickly forms it into a pellet of clay, about the size of a pea,
which she dexterously picks up and flies away back to the
verandah. This pellet is placed on the layer already laid,
carefully smoothed and “bonded in” with the previous
structure, until a cell is completed. Observations made by a
careful student of animal and insect life show that about
twenty-six journeys finish one cell, and that on a fine day it
takes about forty-five minutes to complete it. This is only
one out of many cells, however, placed on the top of each
other.</p>

<p>With regard to the storing of these cells with food for the
grubs of the wasp, Mr Cory<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> found that the number of spiders
enclosed in eleven cells varied from eight to nineteen. These
are caught by the wasp, stung so as to be insensible, but not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
killed, and then the egg is laid in their bodies, so that on being
hatched the grub finds itself in the midst of food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUILDING AND BURROWING WASPS</div>

<p>Another species of these solitary wasps is a much larger
insect, about two inches in length, and she makes nests, which
are extremely hard, and are like half-buried native water-pots,
with the mouths facing the observer, and arranged regularly
one above the other. When finished they are plastered over
with rough gravel. Unlike the wasp previously mentioned,
this one does not fetch the clay for building purposes from the
banks of a stream, but carries the water to the dry earth, which
it then damps and kneads into balls. The cells are stocked
with caterpillars, which are stung and numbed in the same way
as the spiders are treated by the first-named wasp. There are
usually three caterpillars placed in each cell.</p>

<p>Another wasp, also very common, does not build cells, but
digs a burrow in the ground, even in pretty hard places, like a
well-trodden road. Some of these use caterpillars for stocking
their burrows, some large spiders, and some crickets, but all
drag or carry their prey on foot, even the largest of them. One
small wasp, when carrying a spider, first amputates all its legs
and then slings the body beneath her. The burrows of the
larger wasp are deep in comparison with the size of the insect,
being frequently a foot or more in depth. Mr Cory gives a
graphic description of a battle between one of these wasps and a
large spider, in which, however, the former managed to sting its
prey and capture it.</p>

<p>There is one very small wasp that makes no cell or burrow,
but chooses a long hole in a piece of wood, or a small bamboo,
etc., for the rearing of its larvæ. “Each kind of wasp seems
to have its own peculiar way of hunting; some run down on
foot by scent for long distances; some dash down violently
into the web of a spider, and catch him as he drops from out of
it; while others again seize their prey upon the wing, especially
the social wasps. The males of all are lazy and do no work.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>January is usually the wettest month of the year in Imèrina;
and in some years there occurs what the Hova call the <em>hafitòana</em>,
or “seven days”—that is, of almost continuous rain, although
it more usually lasts only three or four days. Such a time is
most disastrous for houses, compounds and boundary walls,
for the continuous rain soaks into them and brings them down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
in every direction. From the steep situation of the capital,
almost every house compound is built up on one side with a
retaining wall, and on the other is cut away so as to form a level
space.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUXURIANT GROWTH</div>

<p>The prolonged moisture, combined with the heat of this time
of the year, naturally makes everything grow luxuriantly. The
hillsides again become green and pleasant to the eye; our
gardens are gay with flowers, and in many places the open
downs display a considerable amount of floral beauty. I have
never seen elsewhere such a profusion of wild flowers as that
which met our view when travelling from the south-west to
Antanànarìvo in December 1887. Leaving Antsìrabé and
proceeding northwards, the level country was gay with flowers,
which literally covered the downs, and in many places gave a
distinct and bright colour to the surface of the ground. Among
these the most prominent was a pale pink flower on stems from
a foot to eighteen inches high, called by the people <em>kòtosày</em>
(<i>Sopubia triphylla</i>), and also the lovely deep blue flower called
<em>nìfinakànga</em>, which latter covered the paths and also occurred
very abundantly among the grass. In many places, especially
near villages, whether deserted or still inhabited, a
plant with small pale blue flowers (various species of <i>Cynoglossum</i>),
almost exactly like our English “forget-me-not,”
grew in dense masses, showing a blue-tinted surface even
at a considerable distance. The <em>vonènina</em>, with a pale pink
flower, was very frequent, as well as several species of
bright yellow flowers, one with a head of minute florets, looking
like a small yellow brush; others were star-shaped, the whole
forming in many places a brilliant mass of gold. Three or four
species of white-flowered plants, one of them a clematis (<i>Clematis
bojeri</i>), were very frequent; and a few late examples of terrestrial
orchids were seen. Five or six weeks previously these were
among the most abundant flowers met with, and their clusters
of waxy-white flowers were very conspicuous. Other species
of orchid, of rich crimson and also of purple, were even more
beautiful.</p>

<p>We reckoned that there were from twenty to thirty different
species of wild flowers then in bloom on these downs of Vàkinankàratra,
gladdening our eyes by their varied beauty and
abundance on that glorious morning. The flowers, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
grew much scarcer as we travelled over higher ground; but six
weeks previously these upper <em>tanèty</em> had also been gay with
great masses of the brilliant crimson flowers of a leguminous
plant, which grew in clusters of many scores of spikes growing
close together. Our ride that day obliged us to modify the
opinions previously held as to the poverty of Madagascar in
wild flowers.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE CHANGING MONTHS IN IMÈRINA: CLIMATE, VEGETATION
AND LIVING CREATURES OF THE INTERIOR</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">AUTUMN: <span class="smcap">March and April.</span>—It will be understood
from what has been previously stated as to the divisions
of the seasons in the Imèrina province that, as with the
seasons in England, there is some variety in different years in
the times when they commence and finish. Generally, both
crops of rice—the earlier and the later—are all cut by the end
of April, although in the northern parts of the province it is
usually five or six weeks after that date. But if the rains are
late, and should happen to be scanty in February and March,
harvest work is still going on at the end of May. In fact, owing
to there being these two crops of rice, with no very exactly
marked division between the two, autumn, in the sense of rice
harvest, is going on for about four months, and sometimes
longer, as just mentioned, and extends over the later months
of summer as well as the two months of autumn or <em>Fàraràno</em>
(March and April). In January those portions of the great
rice-plain which lie north-west of the capital, as well as many
of the lesser plains and valleys, become golden-yellow in hue,
very much indeed like the colour of an English wheat-field in
harvest-time; and after a few days patches of water-covered
field may be noticed in different places, showing where the crop
has been cut, and the few inches of water in which it was growing
show conspicuously in the prospect. As the weeks advance,
this water-covered area extends over larger portions of the rice-plain,
until the whole of the early crop has been gathered in, so
that in many directions there appear to be extensive sheets of
water. I well remember, when once at Ambòhimanàrina, a
large village to the north-west of Antanànarìvo, how strange
it appeared to see people setting out to cross what seemed a
considerable lake. But of course there was no danger, as the
water was only a few inches deep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RICE CROP</div>

<p>As there are channels to conduct water to every rice-field,
small canoes are largely used to bring the rice, both before and
after it has been threshed, to the margin of the higher grounds
and nearer to the roads. At the village just mentioned, which
is like a large island surrounded by a sea of rice-plain, there is
one point where a number of these channels meet and form quite
a port; and a very animated scene it presents at harvest-time,
as canoe after canoe, piled up with heaps of rice in the husk, or
with sheaves of it still unthreshed, comes up to the landing-place
to discharge its cargo.</p>

<p>In a very few weeks’ time the watery covering of the plain is
hidden by another green crop, but not of so bright and vivid a
tint as the fresh-planted and growing rice. This is the <em>kòlikòly</em>,
or after-crop, which sprouts from the roots of the old plants.
This is much shorter in stalk and smaller in ear than the first
crop, and is often worth very little; but if the rains are late, so
that there is plenty of moisture, it sometimes yields a fair
quantity, but it is said to be rather bitter in taste.</p>

<p>In cutting the rice the Malagasy use a straight-bladed knife;
and, as the work proceeds, the stalks are laid in long curving
narrow lines along the field, the heads of one sheaf being covered
over by the cut ends of the stalks of the next sheaf. This is
done to prevent the ears drying too quickly and the grain
falling out before it reaches the threshing-floor. This last-named
accessory to rice-culture is simply a square or circle of
the hard red earth, kept clear from grass and weeds, sometimes
plastered with mud, and generally on the sloping side of the
rising ground close to the rice-field. Here the sheaves are piled
round the threshing-floor like a low breastwork. (Occasionally
the rice is threshed in a space in the centre of the rice-field, mats
being spread over the stubble to prevent loss of the grain.) No
flail is used, but handfuls of the rice-stalks are beaten on a stone
fixed in the ground, until all the grain is separated from the
straw. The unhusked rice is then carried in baskets to the
owner’s compound and is usually stored in large round pits with
a circular opening dug in the hard red soil. These are lined
with straw, and the mouth is covered with a flat stone, which is
again covered over with earth; and in these receptacles it is
generally kept dry and uninjured for a considerable time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BEAUTIFUL BIRDS</div>

<p>In most years the end of April and the beginning of May are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
very busy times with the Malagasy; almost all other work must
give way to the getting in of the harvest; the fields are everywhere
dotted over with people reaping; most of the poorer
people we meet are carrying loads of freshly cut grain on their
heads, or baskets filled with the unhusked rice, and large
quantities are spilt along the roads and paths. Some of the
chief embankments swarm with rats and mice, which must pick
up a very good living at this time of the year. Other creatures
also take toll from the harvest, especially the <em>Fòdy</em>, or cardinal-bird,
the bright scarlet plumage of the cock-bird making a very
noticeable feature of the avi-fauna during the warmer months.
This colour is not seen on the wings, which are sober brown, but
is brilliant on head, breast and back; it fades away in the
winter months, returning again as the breeding-time comes round.
The white egret, which we saw on the coast, is equally in
evidence in Imèrina, and sometimes flocks of two or three
hundred of them may be seen in the rice-fields and marshes.
When living at Ambòhimànga we used to notice that in the
winter months a large number of the <em>Vòrompòtsy</em> were accustomed
to assemble on the open down towards sunset; and on a
signal apparently given by one of them the whole flock rose
and flew slowly away to roost in the large trees to the north-west
of the town. The white-necked crow is also plentiful, and
is perhaps the most commonly seen bird in Imèrina. On one
occasion when walking with a friend near Ambòhimànga, he
had his gun and shot one of a small flock of crows near us. For
a few seconds there was a dead silence, and then all the others
filled the air with hoarse cries and came dashing round us so
closely that I feared they would injure our eyes, so angry did
they seem with those who had killed their companion. One of
the most beautiful birds to be seen is the <em>Vintsy</em>, or kingfisher, of
lovely purplish-blue, with yellow and buff breast and belly.
With short blunt tail and long beak, it may be seen perched on
the rushes or other aquatic plants, or darting over the streams
and marshes, flying in a curious jerking manner, like a flash of
purple light, pursuing the insects which form its food.</p>

<p>From what has been already said about rice-culture it may be
easily understood that it occupies a large amount of the time
and attention of the Malagasy. The digging and preparation
of the ground; the sowing in the <em>kètsa</em> plots; the uprooting of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
the young plants; the planting, by the women, of these again in
the soft mud of the rice-fields; the bringing of water, often from
a long distance, to the fields, and the repairing of the water-courses;
the weeding of the rice-fields; and, finally, the cutting,
the threshing, the bringing home, and the drying and storing
of the rice—all this bulks largely in their daily life through a
good deal of the year. Rice is the staff of life to the Malagasy,
and they cannot understand how Europeans can make a proper
meal without it. <em>Mihìnam-bàry</em>, “to eat rice,” is the native
equivalent for the Eastern phrase, “to eat bread”; they eat
other things of course—manioc root, a little meat or fish, and
various vegetables, but these are only <em>laoka</em> or accompaniments
to the staple food.</p>

<p>The Malagasy have a saying, when speaking of things which
are inseparable, that they are “like rice and water.” And
when we remember that rice is sown on water, that it is transplanted
in water, that it grows still in water, that it is reaped in
water, that it is usually carried by water, in canoes, that it is
boiled in water, and that water is generally the only beverage
with which it is eaten, it will be seen that there is much force
in the comparison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARTICLES OF FOOD</div>

<p>Besides the above-mentioned additions to rice, the people
eat as a relish with it other things, many of them very repulsive
to our European notions—for instance, snails, locusts, certain
kinds of caterpillars, moths, and even, so it is said, some species
of spiders! But I never realised so distinctly what queer
things they will eat as when taking a ride one afternoon to the
north of Ambòhimànga. Passing along one of the long rice-valleys,
we saw some girls dredging for fish in the shallow
water; and thinking we might perhaps buy some to take home,
we called to them to bring the basket for us to see. They
immediately complied, but, on inspecting the contents, we
found no fish, but a heap of brown, crawling, wriggling, slimy
creatures, really very disgusting in appearance, considered as
possible articles of food. This mass of creeping animal life
consisted of shrimps, water-beetles, tadpoles, and the larvæ of
many kind of insects. It is needless to say that we did <em>not</em> make
a purchase of these tempting delicacies; but I believe they
would all go into the pot in some Malagasy house that evening
and give a relish to the rice of some of our native friends.</p>

Fish traps. The way is blocked for fish with occasional openings for traps</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>The rivers of the interior are singularly deficient in fish of any
size; but in the shallow water of the rice-fields numbers of
minute shrimps are caught, as well as small fish of the kinds
called <em>Tòho</em> and <em>Tròndro</em>, but they are very bony and poor in
flavour: somewhat larger kinds, called <em>Màrakèly</em> and <em>Tòhovòkoka</em>,
are, however, very good eating, but are not plentiful. Very
large and fine eels are caught in the rivers, as well as crayfish, of
a kind peculiar to Madagascar. On the water of the streams
many kinds of water-beetles and water-boatmen may be seen
darting about in mazy circles; one of these, called <em>Tsingàla</em>,
causes death if swallowed by cattle or human beings, oxen dying
in less than twenty-four hours, unless a remedy is promptly
given. The Rev. H. T. Johnson wrote thus about this insect:</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TSINGÀLA</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was travelling one day to Ambòhimandròso; the day had
been very hot, and passing by a dirty pool, one of my bearers
stooped down and drank with his hands and then hastily
followed to carry the palanquin. I saw the man drink and
presently, hearing sounds behind, I turned and discovered that
the very man, who only a few minutes before had drunk the
water, was now in agonies of pain. He stood stretching out
both his arms and throwing back his head in a frantic
manner, at the same time shrieking most hideously. My first
thoughts were speedily seconded by the words of his companions,
who said, ‘He has swallowed a <em>tsingàla</em>.’ Of course,
I immediately got down and went back to the poor fellow. He
was now lying on the ground and writhing in agony, and I felt
that unless something could be done, and that speedily, the man
must die. My other bearers, seeing the extreme urgency of the
case, called to the passers-by, but none could render any assistance.
Presently a Bétsiléo was appealed to, and he said that
he knew what would cure him, but wanted to know how much
money we would give. I said immediately that it was no time
for bargaining, but that I would give him sixpence if he relieved
the poor man from his sufferings. Off he ran to procure some
leaves, with which he returned in about ten minutes; he soaked
them in water from a stream close by, and then gave the
sufferer the infusion to drink. With almost the quickness
of a flash of lightning the poor fellow showed signs of relief,
and after drinking this infusion several times more he said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
that he was free from pain, but felt very weak and faint.
It was some weeks before the man got thoroughly strong
again.”</p>
</div>

<p>No one can pass along the little narrow banks and paths which
divide the rice-fields without noticing the large dragonflies
which dart over the water. Their colours are very various. A
rich crimson, steely-blue and old gold are some of these. They
are voracious creatures, as their name implies, and I saw one,
one day, deliberately, and audibly, crunching up a smaller
one. At another time, however, I noticed a fair-sized one being
devoured by a spider, which was barred with lines like a zebra.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARSHES</div>

<p>The marshes in Imèrina are not useless to the people, for a
variety of useful plants grow there and are also planted in them.
Among these are the <em>Hèrana</em>, a sedge which grows to three or
four feet in height, and is extensively used for thatching native
houses. If the roof is a proper pitch this sedge is very durable,
and when cut and trimmed has a very neat appearance. Then
there is the <em>Zozòro</em>, a much taller sedge, closely allied to the
papyrus, with a triangular stem, and a feathery head of flowers.
The strong tough peel is used to make the excellent mats employed
for flooring, and also all sorts and sizes of baskets; the
pith is used for stuffing pillows and mattresses; and the stems
firmly fixed together are used for temporary doors and window
shutters, and for beds. A rush, called <em>Hàzondràno</em>, is employed
for making baskets and mats.</p>

<p>As the colder weather advances, the mornings are often
foggy, at least a thick white mist covers the plains and valleys
soon after the sun rises and remains for an hour or two until
his increasing power disperses it. Seen from the higher grounds
and from the most elevated parts of the capital, this mist often
presents a very beautiful appearance; a billowy sea of vapour
is brilliantly lit up by the sunlight, and out of this sea the hill-tops
rise up like islands. But these misty mornings also reveal
many things which cannot be seen, or can only be seen by very
close observation, in clear sunshine, especially the webs of
various species of spider. There they are all the time, but we
are not aware of their presence except on a misty autumn or
winter morning, when a very delicate thread and filmy net is
marked out by minute drops of moisture which reveal all their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
wonderful beauty of structure. Many kinds of bush are seen
to be almost covered by geometrical webs: one species seems
to choose the extremities of the branches of the <em>sòngosòngo
Euphorbia</em>, but the most common is a web averaging five or six
inches in diameter which is spread horizontally on tufts of grass,
and may be seen by thousands, half-a-dozen or so in a square
yard. This web has a funnel-shaped hole near the centre, with
a little shaft leading down to the ground. Near this, the maker
and tenant of the structure—a little greyish-brown spider about
half-an-inch long—may often be found, if carefully searched for.
As the sun gains power, these numerous webs become almost
invisible, but before the moisture is all dried from them, they
present a beautiful appearance in the sunshine, for they are
exactly like the most delicate gauze, studded with numberless
small diamonds, flashing with all the prismatic colours as we
pass by and catch the light at varying angles.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="neph">SPIDERS</div>

<p>The most conspicuous of the many species of spider seen in
Madagascar is a large <i>Nephila</i>, a creature about an inch and a
half long, with a spread of legs six or seven inches in diameter.
It is handsomely marked with red and yellow, and may be
noticed by scores in the centre of its geometric web stretching
across the branches of trees. From the considerable distances
spanned by the main guys and supports of its great net, this
spider is called by the Malagasy <em>Mampìta-hàdy</em>, or “fosse-crosser”;
and these main lines are strong enough to entangle
small birds, for at the mission station at Ambàtoharànana a
cardinal-bird and a kingfisher were both caught in these nets.
The male spider is only about a quarter the size of the female
as just described, and, sad to say, he frequently is caught and
devoured by his affectionate spouse, after mating. Attempts
have been made, and with some success, to employ the silk
made by this spider in the manufacture of a woven fabric; but
it is very doubtful whether such silk could be procured in such
quantities as to be of commercial value.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS</div>

<p>Silk from the silkworm moth is produced to a considerable
extent, and, as we have seen in speaking of native weaving, is
employed in manufacturing a variety of handsome <em>làmbas</em>.
The moth is a large and beautiful insect, with shades of buff and
brown and yellow, and with a large eye-like spot on the hind
wings. The caterpillars are fed on the leaves of the mulberry-trees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
and also on those of the <em>tapia</em> (<i>Chrysopia sp.</i>) shrub.
Another moth, somewhat like the silk-producing one in colouring,
has an extraordinary development of the hind wings, which
have long delicate tail-like appendages; these have extremely
narrow shafts and are enlarged at the ends. Their points have
two spiral twists or folds, very graceful in appearance. There
are four distinct eye-like spots near the centre of each wing,
which are light buff in colour, with lemon-yellow. The insect
measures eight and a half inches from shoulder to point of tail,
and eight inches across the upper wings. It is allied to <i>Tropæa
leto</i>. Some species of moth, very dark brown in colour, and
yet beautifully marked, often fly into our houses at night, the
female being much larger than the male. The Malagasy are
afraid of seeing these almost black-looking insects, which they
call <em>lòlom-pàty</em> (“death-moths”), in their houses, as they think
them presages of evil and death. Another moth, with death’s-head
marking on its thorax, is also often seen. But the most
beautiful of the Malagasy lepidoptera is a diurnal moth, which
one would always call a butterfly—viz. the <i>Urania riphæa</i>, a
large and lovely insect, with golden-green, crimson and black
markings, and edged all round its wings and tails with delicate
pure white. It is a curious fact that the nearest ally to this
Madagascar species is a native of Hayti and Cuba (<i>U. sloana</i>),
a remarkable instance of discontinuity of habitat. This fact,
however, has a parallel in the family of small insectivorous
animals <ins class="corr" id="tn-110" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'called Centelidæ'">
called Centetidæ</ins>, which are also confined to Madagascar
and some of the West India islands. During 1899 this butterfly
was unusually abundant, while in some seasons it is seldom
seen. At Isoàvina I noticed a great many flying around the
tall blue-gum trees in the dusk of the evening. Great numbers
also were seen at Ambòhimànga in the garden there. They
appeared to be intoxicated with the strong flavour of the nectar
from the loquat-trees, then in flower, so that almost any
quantity of them could have been captured in the early morning,
while still under the influence of the flowers, which have a
powerful scent of prussic acid. The Malagasy call it
<em>Andrìandòlo</em>—<em>i.e.</em> “king-butterfly.”</p>

<p>In these bare upper highlands of Madagascar butterflies are
not found in as great variety as in the warmer regions of the
island. Still there are a few species which are common enough,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
the most plentiful being one which is satiny-blue above and
spotted with brown and grey underneath. This is to be seen
all the year round, especially hovering over the euphorbia
hedges which divide plantations from the roads. Another,
also tolerably common, is a large reddish-brown butterfly, the
wings edged with black and white. More rare is an insect with
four large round white spots on dark chocolate-brown wings;
and another, dark brown in colour, with eye-like spots of blue
and red. Several small species, yellow, white, or brown, or
silvery-grey and blue, are found hovering over, or settling on,
damp places; and there are two or three white species, with
black spots or lines on the edges of the wings. In the warmer
season a handsome large <i>Papilio</i> is rather common in our
gardens, with dark green and sulphur-yellow spots and markings.
The eggs of some of these are beautiful objects in the
microscope, being fluted and sculptured like a Greek vase. My
friend, M. Ch. Matthey, who has made large collections of
Madagascar insects, tells me that there are a few cases of
mimicry and dimorphism, especially the latter, among the
butterflies of the interior.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GRASSHOPPERS, CRICKETS AND LOCUSTS</div>

<p>On the open downs, and when the sun is shining, the air is
filled with the hum of chirping insect life from the many species
of grasshoppers, crickets and small locusts which cover the
ground. Every step among the long dry grass disturbs a score
of these insects, which leap in all directions from one’s path as
we proceed, sometimes dashing on one’s face with a smart blow.
The majority of these are of various shades of brown and green,
and some of the larger species of grasshopper are remarkable
for their protective colouring. Here is one whose legs and wings
are exactly like dry grass; the body is like a broad blade of some
green plant, the antennæ are two little tufts, like yellow grass,
and the eyes are just like two small brown seeds. But, curiously
enough, when it flies, a pair of bright scarlet wings make its
flight very conspicuous. You pursue it, to catch such a brightly
coloured insect, when it settles, and lo! it has vanished, only
something resembling green or dry grass remains, which it requires
sharp eyes to distinguish from the surrounding herbage.
Other grasshoppers are entirely like green grass blades and
stalks, and others again resemble, equally closely, dried grass;
and unless the insects move under one’s eyes it is almost impossible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
to detect them. One is puzzled to guess where the vital
organs can be placed in such dry-looking little sticks. There is
one species of mantis also, which, in the shape and colour of its
wings, legs, antennæ and body, presents as close a resemblance
to its environment as do the grasshoppers. Their curious
heads, however, which turn round and look at one in quite an
uncanny manner, and their formidably serrated fore legs or
arms, put up in mock pious fashion, give them a distinctly
different appearance from the other insects. In the dry and
cooler season on almost every square foot of ground is a large
brown caterpillar, often many of them close together, feeding
on the young blades of grass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROTECTIVE RESEMBLANCE</div>

<p>But the most handsome insect one sees on the downs is the
<em>Valàlanambòa</em> or dog-locust. This is large and is gorgeously
coloured, the body being barred with stripes of yellow and
black, while the head and thorax are green and blue and gold,
with shades of crimson, and the wings are bright scarlet. It
seems a most desirable insect for a cabinet, but it is impossible
to keep one, for it has a most abominable smell, and this appears
to be its protection, as well as its probable possession of a
nauseous taste, so that no bird or other creature feeds upon it.
This insect seems therefore a good example of “warning
colours”; it has no need of “protective resemblance” lest it
should be devoured by enemies; it can flaunt its gay livery
without fear, indeed this seems exaggerated in order to say to
outsiders, “Hands off!” “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemo me impune lacessit.</i>” The
Malagasy have a proverb which runs thus: “<em>Valàlanambòa:
ny tompony aza tsy tia azy</em>”—<em>i.e.</em> “The dog-locust, even its
owner dislikes it.”</p>

<p>On the Imèrina downs, and on the outskirts of the forest, there
are occasionally seen some enormous earthworms. These are
about four times the size, both in length and thickness, of those
we see in England; and when I first saw a small group of them
they seemed more like small serpents than worms. Darwin’s
researches on the part played by earthworms in the renewal
of the soil have shown us what a valuable work these humble
creatures do for our benefit; and on a morning after a little
rain has fallen the grass here in Imèrina is sometimes almost
covered by the innumerable little mounds of fresh earth brought
up by worms, thus confirming what he has told us about them.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>The aspect of vegetation, except in the rice-fields, can hardly
be said to change much during the autumn months. A plant
with pale yellow flowers may be noticed by thousands in marshy
grounds, giving quite a mass of colour in many places. A
significant name given to autumn is <em>Ménàhitra</em>—<em>i.e.</em> “the
grass is red”—that is, turning brown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Winter: May, June, July and August.</span>—As already
mentioned in the introductory sentences of the <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">previous chapter</a>,
winter in central Madagascar is very different from winter in
England. We have no snow, nor is there any native word for
it, for even the highest peaks of Ankàratra are too low for snow
to fall on them; we never see ice (although adventurous
foreigners have once or twice seen a thin film of it on pools on
the highest hillsides); hoar-frost, however, is not uncommon,
and occasionally the leaves of some species of vegetables, as well
as those of the banana, turn black with the keen night air. And
since there is no rain during our Imèrina winter, the paths are
dry, and it is the best time for making long journeys, especially
as there is little to be feared from fever when going about at this
season of the year. Winter is therefore a pleasant time; the
skies are generally clear, the air is fresh and invigorating, and to
the cool and bracing temperature of the winter months is
doubtless largely due the health and strength which many
Europeans enjoy for years together in the central provinces of
Madagascar.</p>

<p>The long period without rain at this season naturally dries
up the grass, and the hills and downs become parched and
brown. <em>Maìntàny</em>—<em>i.e.</em> “the earth is dry”—is one of the native
names for this season, and it is very appropriate to the condition
of things in general. The rice-fields lie fallow, affording a scanty
supply of grass for the cattle; and many short cuts can be
made across them in various directions, for the beaten track over
embankments, great and small, may be safely left for the dry
and level plain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANCIENT TOWNS</div>

<p>In travelling about Imèrina, and indeed in the southern
central provinces as well, one cannot help noticing the evidences
of ancient towns and villages on the summits of a large number
of the high hills. These are not picturesque ruins, or remains
of buildings, but are the deep fosses cut in the hard red soil,
often three or four, one within the other, by which these old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
villages were defended. These show very conspicuously from
a great distance, and are from ten to twenty feet deep; and
as they are often of considerable extent they must have
required an immense amount of labour to excavate. These
elaborate fortifications are memorials of the “feudal period”
in central Madagascar, when almost every village had its
petty chief or <em>mpanjàka</em>, and when guns and gunpowder
were still unknown. These old places are now mostly
abandoned for more convenient positions in the plains or
on the low rising grounds; and the fosses or <em>hàdy</em> are
often capital hunting-grounds for ferns and other wild
plants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOVA TOMBS</div>

<p>Perhaps more noticeable even than the old towns are the old
tombs, as well as more modern ones, which meet one’s eye in
the neighbourhood of every village. The Hova tombs are
mostly constructed of rough stonework, undressed and laid
without mortar; they are square in shape, from ten to twenty
feet or more each way, and generally of two or three stages of
three to four feet high, diminishing in size from the lowest.
This superstructure surrounds and surmounts a chamber
formed of massive slabs of bluish-grey granitic rock, partly sunk
in the ground, and partly above it. In this chamber are stone
shelves, on which the corpses, wrapped in a number of silk
cloths or <em>làmba</em>, are laid. The tombs of wealthy people, as well
as those of high rank, are often costly structures of dressed
stonework, with cornices and carving; some are surmounted
with an open arcade, and have stone shafts to carry lightning
conductors. Within the last few years some large tombs have
been made of burnt brick (externally), although no change is
made in the ancient style of interior construction, with single
stones for walls, roof, door and shelves. Near some villages
are a large number of these great family tombs; and at one
place, on the highroad from the present to the old capital, a
long row of such tombs, from thirty to forty in all, may be seen.
In many places a shapeless heap of stones, often overshadowed
by a <em>Fàno</em> tree, resembling an acacia, marks a grave of the
Vazìmba, the earlier inhabitants of the country. These are
still regarded with superstitious dread and veneration by the
people, and offerings of rice, sugar-cane and other food are often
placed on them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
The winter months are a favourite time for the native
custom of <em>famadìhana</em>—that is, of wrapping the corpses of their
deceased relatives in fresh silk cloths, as well as removing some
of them to a new tomb as soon as this is finished. These are
quite holiday occasions and times of feasting and, not
infrequently, of much that is evil in the way of drinking
and licentiousness.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-capy">OTHER noticeable objects when travelling about the
central provinces are tall stones of rough undressed
granite, from eight to twelve feet high, called <em>Vàtolàhy</em>
(<em>i.e.</em> “Male stones”), which have been erected in memory of
some bygone worthy, or of some notable event, now forgotten,
and which often crown the top of prominent hills. They are
also sometimes memorials of those who went away to the wars of
olden times, and who never returned to their homes. In these
cases a square of small stones—at least three sides of one—is
formed as part of the memorial, as a kind of pseudo-tomb.
These little enclosures are from eight to ten feet square. A
wonderful variety of lichens is often to be seen on these tall
stones—red, yellow, grey of many shades, black, and pure
white embroidering the rough stone. Some have supposed,
from the name of these memorials, that we have here a relic
of phallic worship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARKETS</div>

<p>A very prominent feature of the social life of the Malagasy is
the system of holding large open-air markets all over the central
province on the various days of the week. The largest of these
is naturally that held in the capital every Friday (Zomà), at
which probably from twenty thousand to thirty thousand
people are densely crowded together, and where almost everything
grown or manufactured in the province can be purchased.
But two or three of the other markets held within five or six
miles of Antanànarìvo do not fall far short of the Zomà market
in size, especially those at Asabòtsy (Saturday) to the north,
and at Alàtsinainy (Monday) to the north-east. To a stranger
these great markets present a very novel and interesting scene,
and a good idea may be obtained as to what can be purchased
here by taking a stroll through them and noticing their different
sections. In one part are oxen and sheep, many of which are
killed in the morning, while the meat is cut up and sold during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
the day; here are turkeys, geese, ducks and fowls by the
hundred; here are great heaps of rice, both in the husk, and
either partially cleaned, as “red rice,” or perfectly so, as
“white rice”; here are piles of brown locusts, heaps of minute
red shrimps, and baskets of snails, all used as “relishes” for
the rice; here is <em>màngahàzo</em>, or manioc root, both cooked and
raw, as well as sweet potatoes, earth-nuts, arum roots (<em>saonjo</em>)
and many kinds of green vegetables, and also capsicums,
chillies and ginger. In another quarter are the stalls for
cottons and prints, sheetings and calicoes from Europe, as well
as native-made cloths of hemp, <em>rofìa</em> fibre, cotton and silk; and
not far away are basketfuls and piles of snowy or golden-coloured
cocoons of native silk for weaving. Here is the ironmongery
section, where good native-made nails, rough hinges,
and locks and bolts, knives and scissors can be bought; and
formerly were the sellers of the neat little scales of brass or iron,
with their weights for weighing the “cut money,” which
formed the small change of the Malagasy before foreign occupation.
(The five-franc pieces were cut up in pieces of all shapes
and sizes, so that buying and selling were very tedious matters.)
Then we come to the vendors of the strong and cheap mats and
baskets, made from the tough peel of the <em>zozòro</em> papyrus, and
from various kinds of grass, often with graceful interwoven
patterns. Yonder a small forest of upright pieces of wood
points out the timber market, where beams and rafters, joists
and boarding can be purchased, as well as bedsteads, chairs and
doors. Not far distant from this is the place where large
bundles of <em>hèrana</em> sedge, arranged in sheets or “leaves,” as the
Malagasy call them, for roofing, can be bought; and near these
again are the globular water-pots or <em>sìny</em> for fetching and for
storing water. But it would occupy too much space to enumerate
all the articles for sale in an Imèrina market. Before the
French occupation it was not uncommon to see slaves exposed
for sale, but happily that and slavery are now things of the past.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A NATIONAL ASSEMBLY</div>

<p>In the old times of Malagasy independence there were few
more interesting scenes than that presented by a great national
assembly or <em>Kabàry</em>. These were summoned when new laws
were made, or a new government policy was announced, and
also when war was imminent with France, both in 1882 and
again in 1895. On such occasions the large triangular central<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
space near the summit of the capital, called Andohàlo, was
filled with many thousands of people from early morning.
Lines of native troops kept open lanes for the advance of the
queen’s representative, generally the Prime Minister, who was
always attended by a number of officers in a variety of gorgeous
uniforms. At the eastern or highest portion of Andohàlo a
place was kept open for the royal messengers, whose approach
was announced by the firing of cannon. Taking his stand so as
to be seen by the vast assembly, the Prime Minister would draw
his sword and commence the proceedings by turning towards
the palace and giving the word of command for a royal salute,
all the troops presenting arms, and all the cannon round the
upper portion of the city being fired. The next officer in rank
then took the word, and the troops all saluted the Prime Minister,
who stood bareheaded, acknowledging the respect due to his
high position. He then proceeded to give the royal message, or
read the new laws, often with a great deal of eloquence, for the
Malagasy are ready and clever speakers. At passages where
the national pride or patriotism was touched, much enthusiastic
response was often aroused, especially as each paragraph of the
speech was followed by a question: “<em>Fa tsy izày, va, ry ambànilànitra?</em>”
(“For is it not so, ye ‘under-the-heaven’?”)
These questions were replied to with shouts of “<em>Izày!</em>” (“It
is so!”) from the assembled multitude. But the greatest
pitch of loyal enthusiasm was generally evoked by the chiefs
of the different tribes, as they, one after another, replied to the
queen’s message and gave assurances of obedience and loyalty.
Surrounded by a small group of their fellow-clansmen, they
would wind their <em>làmba</em> round their waists, brandish a spear,
and at the conclusion of each part of their speech they also
demanded: “<em>Fa tsy izày va?</em>” And sometimes the whole of
the people would leap to their feet, the officers waving their
swords, the soldiers tossing up their rifles, and the people
dancing about in a perfect frenzy of excitement.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">STONE GATEWAYS</div>

<p>We noticed just now the signs of the ancient villages and
towns in the central province; but something may be added
here as to the existing villages we see as we travel through it.
The ancient towns were, as we have seen, all built for safety
on the top of hills, and many of those now inhabited by the
people are still so situated, although in several districts the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
French authorities have obliged them to leave the old sites and
build their houses, with plenty of space round each, on the sides
of the newly made roads. But a good number of the old style of
village still remain, and it is these I want to describe. They
mostly have deep fosses, cut in the hard red soil, surrounding
them, about twenty to thirty feet across, and as many feet deep,
sometimes still deeper; and before guns and cannons were
brought into the country they must have formed very effective
defences against an enemy, especially as there is often a double
or even treble series of them. The gateways, sometimes three
deep, are formed of stone, often in large slabs, and instead of a
gate a great circular stone, eight or ten feet in diameter, was
rolled across the opening and was fitted into rough grooves on
either side, and wedged up with other stones inside the gate.
I have slept in villages where it was necessary to call several
men before one could leave in the morning, until they had
answered our inquiry: “Who shall roll us away the stone?”
In these fosses, which are of course always damp, with good
soil, ferns and wild plants grow luxuriantly; and the bottom
forms a plantation in which peach, banana, guava and other
fruit trees are cultivated, as well as coffee, arums and a variety
of vegetables. Tall trees often grow there, so that these <em>hàdy</em>
or fosses are often the prettiest feature of the village. It must
be added that the paths between and leading to the gateways
are often winding, and formed by a thick mass of prickly
plants.</p>

<p>In some parts of the central provinces the villages have no
deep trenches round them, but they are protected by a dense
and wide plantation of prickly pear. The thick, fleshy, twisted
stems, the gaily tinted flowers, and even the fruits, are all
armed with spines and stinging hairs; and it is no easy matter
to get rid of the minute little needles, if they once get into one’s
skin. So one sees that a thick hedge of prickly pear was a very
effectual defence against enemies, especially since the people
wore no shoes or any protection for legs and feet. In many
places, instead of prickly pear, the fence round the village is
made of <em>tsiàfakòmby</em> (“impassable by cattle”), a shrub with
bright yellow flowers and full of hook-like prickles. In some
cases, instead of a door at the gateway, a number of short poles
are hung from a cross-piece at the top, which passes through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
a hole in each of them; and one has to hold up two or three
poles in order to pass through.</p>

<p>Here, however, we are at last inside the village, and we see at
once that it is a very different place from an English village,
with the turnpike road passing through it, its trim houses and
cottages, with neat gardens and flower-beds, its grey old church,
and its churchyard with elms and yews overshadowing the
graves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MALAGASY VILLAGE</div>

<p>There is nothing at all like this in our Malagasy village.
There are no streets intersecting it, and the houses are built
without much order, except in one point—namely, that they are
almost all built north and south, and that they have their single
door and window always on the west side, so as to be protected
from the cold and keen south-east winds which blow over
Imèrina during a great part of the year. The houses are mostly
made of the hard red earth, laid in courses of a foot or so high.
They are chiefly of one storey and of one room, but they
generally have a floor in the roof, which is used for cooking;
and, if of good size, they are sometimes divided into two rooms
by rush and mat partitions. On the east of Imèrina, near the
forest, the houses are made of rough wooden framing, filled
up with bamboo or rush, and often plastered with cow-dung.
In the neighbourhood of the capital, and indeed in most places,
the houses are now often made of sun-dried bricks, in two
storeys, with several rooms, and often with tiled roofs.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="p1201_ill" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p1201_ill.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Friday Market at Antanànarìvo</span><br />

This was before the French Conquest. Note the different types of houses, tiled and thatched</div>
</div>

<p>Here and there throughout the province one comes across a
village which was formerly the capital of a petty kingdom, where
we find several strong and well-built timber houses. Such a
place was Ambòhitritankàdy (I say “was,” because it now
no longer exists), one of the villages in my mission district. It
was on a high hill, and in the centre of the village were ten large
houses of massive timber framing and with very high-pitched
roofs, with long “horns” at the gables, and these were arranged
five on each side of a long oblong space sunk a couple of feet
below the ground. Here, in former times, bull-fights took
place, and various games and amusements were carried on. One
of the houses, where the chief himself resided, was much larger
than the rest, and the corner posts, as well as the great central
posts supporting the ridge, were very massive pieces of timber.
It was all in one great room, without any partitions, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
being well floored with wood, and the walls covered with fine
mats. Similar houses might be seen at most of the chief towns
of Imèrina; but the house I have just described was the largest
and finest of any, not excepting those in the capital and at
Ambòhimànga. Sad to say, except at these two places, where
two ancient timber houses at the first one, and one at the other,
are still preserved as a kind of curiosity, almost all these fine
structures have been demolished in order to get well-seasoned
timber for furniture and buildings. They have been superseded
by much less picturesque, but perhaps more comfortable as well
as cheaper, houses of sun-dried or burnt brick.</p>

<p>There is no privacy or retirement about the houses in the
village, no back-yard or outbuildings, although occasionally
low walls make a kind of enclosure around some of them.
Here and there among the houses are square pits, four or five
feet deep, and eight or ten feet square, called fàhitra. These
are pens for the oxen, which are kept in them to be fattened,
formerly especially for the national festival of the New Year.
As may be supposed, these are very dirty places, and in the wet
season are often just pools of black mud; indeed the village,
as a whole, is anything but neat and clean. All sorts of rubbish
and filth accumulate; there are no sanitary arrangements;
frequently the cattle used to be penned for the night in a part of
the village, and the cow-dung made it very muddy in wet
weather, and raised clouds of stifling dust when it was dry.
Frequently the cow-dung is collected and made into circular
cakes of six or eight inches diameter, which are then stuck on
the walls of the houses to dry. This is used as fuel for burning;
and splitting off large slabs of gneiss rock, which are employed
by the people in making their tombs.</p>

<p>In the centre of the village may often be seen the large
family tomb of the chief man of the place, the owner of much
of the land and many of the neighbouring rice-fields. If he is
an andrìana, or of noble birth, the stonework is surmounted
by a small wooden house, with thatched or shingled roof, and a
door, but no window. This is called <em>tràno màsina</em>, “sacred
house,” or <em>tràno manàra</em>, “cold house,” because it has no
hearth or fire.</p>

<p>Seen from a distance, these Malagasy villages often look very
pretty and picturesque, for “distance lends enchantment to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
view.” Round some of them tall trees, called <em>àviàvy</em>, a species of
<i>ficus</i>, grow, which are something like an English elm in appearance.
In others one or two great <em>amòntana</em> trees may be seen;
these are also a species of fig-tree, and have large and glossy
leaves. The <em>amòntana</em> is evergreen, while the <em>àviàvy</em> is deciduous.
A beautiful tree, called <em>zàhana</em>, is also common, with
hundreds of pink flowers and sweetish fruit like a pea-pod. In
the fosses is often seen the <em>amìana</em>, a tall tree-nettle, with large
deeply cut and velvety leaves with stinging hairs. Many
kinds of shrubs often make the place gay with flowers, especially
in the hot season.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOVA CHILDREN</div>

<p>But what are the Hova children like? How are they dressed?
And what do they play at? They are brown-skinned, some
very light olive in colour, and some much darker. As a rule
they have little clothing; perhaps some of the boys may have
a straw hat, but no shoes or stockings, and they are often dirty
and little cared for. On Sundays and on special occasions the
girls are often dressed in print frocks, and the boys in jackets of
similar material, and with a clean white calico <em>làmba</em> overall;
but on weekdays a small <em>làmba</em> of soiled and coarse hemp cloth
often forms almost their only clothing. Of course the children
of well-to-do people are sometimes very nicely dressed, although
they too often go about in a rather dirty fashion. I am here,
however, speaking of the majority of the children one sees,
those of the poorer children of a village.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> One day some of us
went for a ride to a village about two miles from Ambòhimànga.
A number of children followed us about as we collected ferns
in a <em>hàdy</em>, and, as a group of seven or eight of them sat near us,
we calculated that the value of all they had on would not amount
to one shilling!</p>

<p>Poor children! they have little advantages compared with
English boys and girls, and they have few amusements. They
sometimes play at a game which is very like our “fox and
geese”; the boys spin peg-tops and play at marbles; the
little children make figures of oxen and birds, etc., out of clay;
the boys are fond of a game resembling the lassoing of wild
oxen, by trying to catch their companions by throwing a noose
over them; and the big boys have a rough and violent game
called <em>mamèly dìa mànga</em>, in which they try to throw an opponent
down by kicking backward at each other, with the sole of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
foot, which is darted out almost as high as their heads. Ribs
are sometimes broken by a violent kick. Perhaps the most
favourite amusement of Malagasy children is to sit in parties
out of doors on fine moonlight nights and sing away for hours
some of the monotonous native chants, accompanying them
with regular clapping of hands.</p>

<p>In about a fourth of these villages, where there are churches,
a mission day school is still carried on, and here may be seen, if
we look in, a number of bright-looking children repeating their
<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>d</em> (not <em>c</em>), reading and writing, doing sums, learning a little
grammar and geography, and being taught their catechism, and
something about the chief facts and truths of the Bible. And
perhaps there is no more pleasant sight in Madagascar than
one of the larger chapels on the annual examination day, filled
with children from the neighbouring villages, all dressed in
their best, eager to show their knowledge, and pleased to get
the Bible or Testament or hymn-book or other prize given to
those who have done well.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GLORIOUS SUNSETS</div>

<p>A few words may be said here about the aspect of the heavens
in Imèrina, especially at evening and night. We are highly
favoured in having sunsets of wonderful beauty; the western
sky burns with molten gold, orange and crimson; and as the
sun nears the horizon, the ruddy landscape to the east is lighted
up more and more intensely every moment with glowing colour,
the natural hue of the soil being heightened by the horizontal
rays; the distant lines of hill, range after range, are bathed in
every shade of purple light, and the long lines of red clay walls
glow like vermilion in the setting sunshine. How often have
we watched this glorious display of light and colour, and thanked
God for this beautiful world!</p>

<p>But the nights, especially near the time of full moon, are also
very enjoyable. The moon appears more brilliant and her light
more intense than in England; it is a delight to be out of doors
and to walk in the fresh bracing air, and to have the rough paths
illuminated for us by the silvery radiance, which gives a picturesque
beauty to the most commonplace objects and scenes.</p>

<p>Perhaps the starlit skies of the evenings of the summer
months are the most beautiful of all the year. At this season
some of the finest of the northern constellations are seen at the
same time as several of the southerly ones. The Great Bear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
stretches over the northern sky; higher up is the Northern
Crown; the Pleiades,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and Orion with his many brilliant
neighbours, are overhead; the Southern Cross, with its conspicuous
“pointers” in the Centaur, is high in the southern
heavens; and the Magellan Clouds are clearly seen nearer the
horizon; and all across the firmament is the Galaxy, or, as the
Malagasy call it, the <em>èfi-taona</em>, “the division,” or “separation
of the year.” And then, as the circling year revolves, the great
serpentine curve of Scorpio appears, and Sirius, Capella,
Canopus, and many another glorious lamp of heaven light up
the midnight sky with their flashing radiance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TEMPERATURE</div>

<p>The month of August, the closing one in this review of the
year, is often the coldest month of all, cold, that is, for a country
within the tropics. All through August the keen south-eastern
trades generally blow strong, and although in sheltered places
the afternoon sun may be quite warm, the mornings and evenings
are very cold, and during the night the mercury will often
descend to very near the freezing-point. The mornings are
frequently misty; on some days there are constant showers of
<em>èrika</em> or drizzly rain, alternating with bright sunny days and
clear skies; these latter seem the very perfection of weather,
bracing and health-giving. But this cold weather often brings
disease to the Malagasy, especially a kind of malarial fever,
which sometimes attacks great numbers of them, and also
brings affections of the throat and chest, to which many fall
victims. At such times their thin cotton clothing seems ill
adapted for protection against the climate. This circumstance
has often struck me as showing how difficult it is to change the
habits of a people; for centuries past the Hova have lived in
this cool highland region, yet, until very lately, few comparatively
have made much change in their dress, which was well
enough adapted for the purely tropical region from which
they originally came, but very unfitted for the cool air of the
winter months of a country about five thousand feet above
sea-level.</p>

<p>The great rice-plain to the west of the capital and all the
broader valleys still lie fallow, although in various places
extensive sheets of water show that irrigation is commencing.
In the lesser valleys and at the edge of the larger rice-plains the
landscape is enlivened by the bright green of the <em>kètsa</em> grounds,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
where, as already described, the rice is sown broadcast before
transplanting into the larger fields.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TREES</div>

<p>There are not many deciduous trees in Imèrina, so the
numerous orchards, chiefly of mango-trees, look fresh and green
throughout the year. But the Cape lilac, which does cast its
leaves, is beginning to put out its bright green fronds; the
peach-trees are a mass of pink blossom, unrelieved as yet by any
leaves, and the <em>sòngosòngo</em> (<i>Euphorbia splendens</i>), in the hedges
is just beginning to show its brilliant scarlet or pale yellow
bracts. Wild flowers are still scarce, but the lilac flowers of
the <em>sèvabé</em> (<i>Solanum auriculatum</i>) bloom all through the year.
The golden-orange panicles of the <em>sèva</em> (<i>Buddleia madagascariensis</i>),
which has a sweetish scent, now appear. Nature
is arousing from the inaction of the cold season, and the few
trees now flowering give promise of the coming spring. And so,
from year to year, every month brings some fresh interest in
tree and flower, in bird and insect, in the employments of the
people, and in the changing aspects of the sky by day and in the
starry heavens by night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—I may add here that of late years, through foreign
influence preceding and following the French occupation, many
new trees have been introduced into Madagascar, which have
materially altered the look of the country in some provinces,
especially in the Bétsiléo district. Millions of trees, chiefly
species of eucalyptus, have been planted, especially along the
roadsides, as well as mimosa, blackwood and <em>filào</em>. The
beautiful purple bracts of the bougainvillea, and the large
brilliant scarlet ones of the poinsettia, now give a much brighter
appearance to gardens and public places, since they have been
extensively planted in the capital and other large towns, as well
as zinnias, crotons and cannas.</p>


<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> Of late years, since numbers of children attend Government
schools as well as those of the various missions, a considerable
improvement has taken place in children’s clothing. Knickerbockers
and jackets are now the dress of hundreds of boys; but
the native <em>làmba</em> is still largely used, and is almost always part
of girls’ dress.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<div class="sidenote">STARS</div>

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> Curiously enough, the Malagasy appear to have given names
only to these two prominent clusters of stars. The Pleiades
they call “<em>Kòtokèli-miàdi-laona</em>”—<em>i.e.</em> “Little boys fighting over

<span class="fs70">AT THE FOREST SANATORIUM</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">BY the kind concern of two of the missionary societies
working in Madagascar for the comfort and health of
their representatives, who live in Imèrina, two sanatoriums
have been provided for them away from the capital.
One of these is at Ambàtovòry, about fifteen miles distant to
the east, and close to a patch of old forest still left among the
surrounding somewhat bare country; the other is at Ankèramadìnika,
at about double that distance, and is built close
to the edge of the upper belt of forest, that long line of woods
which, as already mentioned, stretches for several hundred miles
along the eastern side of Madagascar. Here, after a year’s
strenuous work in college, or school, or church, or in literary
labour, or in something of them all, it is a pleasant and healthful
change to come for two or three weeks to the quiet and restful
influences of the beautiful woods, with their wealth of vegetable
life, and with much to interest in the animal life of bird and
insect.</p>

<p>I ask my readers to accompany me then in a visit to Ankèramadìnika,
and to wander with me in the forest and observe
the many curious and interesting things which we shall find in
our walks. The forest is here about seven or eight miles across,
and from the verandah we can see over the woods to the lower
plain of Ankay, and beyond this to the long line of blue mountains
covered by the lower and broader forest belt. A wonderful
sight this plain presents on a winter morning, when it is filled
with a white sea of mist, out of which the forest and the hills
rise like islands, and the feathery masses of cloud against their
sides have exactly the effect of waves breaking against a shore.</p>

<p>It will be fitting here to say a few words about the flora of
Madagascar, and here I may quote what my late friend, the
Rev. R. Baron, remarked in a paper read before the Linnæan
Society in 1888.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> He says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It may now be said that the vegetable productions of the
island have been very extensively explored, and that the majority
of the plants inhabiting it are known to science. The country
has been traversed by botanists in many different directions, its
highest mountains have been ascended, its lakes and marshes
crossed, its forests penetrated, and large collections of plants
have been made. About four thousand one hundred species of
plants have now been named and described, and I think it may
be said with certainty that the great bulk of Madagascarian
plants have already been gathered, so that we have now
sufficient data to enable us to draw a few general conclusions
as to the character and distribution of this very interesting
and remarkable flora. Of the four thousand one hundred
indigenous plants at present known in Madagascar, about
three thousand (or three-fourths of the total flora) are, remarkable
to say, only found here. Even of the grasses and
rushes, about two-fifths of each order are peculiar to the island.
There is one natural order confined to Madagascar, the Chlænaceæ;
of ferns more than a third are endemic, and of orchids as
much as five-sixths, facts which are sufficient to give a very
marked individuality to the character of the flora.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr Baron gives the following graphic account of his experiences
as a collector of plants:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="sidenote">BOTANISING IN MADAGASCAR</div>

<p>“Botanising in Madagascar, as those who have travelled in
wild and uncivilised regions in other parts of the world will
easily believe, is a totally different experience from botanising
in England. Your collecting materials are carried by a native,
who may be honest, or not, in which latter case the drying
paper will begin gradually and mysteriously to disappear, and
the leather straps with which the presses are tightened will,
one by one, be quietly appropriated. For a Malagasy bearer
has a special weakness for leather straps, they being largely
used for belts, so that both for the sake of your own comfort
and the honesty of the men, the sooner you dispense with
them the better. As for the dried plants themselves, they are
secure from all pilfering; for of what possible use or value
they can be, it puzzles the natives to conceive. You might
leave your collection in a village for a whole month, and you
would find on your return it was still intact. If, after a day’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
journey, you sit down in a hut to change the sheets of paper
containing the specimens, the villagers will be sure to come
and, standing round in a circle, gaze at you in mute astonishment
turning over the plants so well known to them. After
a few minutes’ silent gaze, there will perhaps be a sudden
outburst of amused laughter, or it may be a little whispering,
which, if it were audible, would be something to this effect:
‘Whatever in the world is the man doing?’ or, ‘What strange
creatures these white men are!’</p>

<p>“Some of the people doubtless think that you are a kind of
sorcerer. For these dried plants—whatever can you do with
them? You cannot eat them. You cannot make them into broth.
You cannot plant them, for they are dead. You cannot form
them in bouquets or wreaths, for they are brown and withered.
Is it surprising, then, if some of the natives think that you are
dabbling in the black art, and that your plants, in the shape of
some strange and mysterious decoction, are to supply, it may be,
a potent rain-medicine, or a love-philtre, or a disease-preventing
physic? For among the natives themselves there are many
herbal quacks, who, for a consideration, are able, not only to
prescribe for the cure, and even prevention, of disease, but also
to furnish charms against fire and tempest, locusts or lightning,
leprosy or lunacy, ghosts, crocodiles, or witches. The explanation
which I have most frequently heard given, however, by
the more intelligent of the natives as to the use of the dried
plants is that the leaves are intended to be employed for
patterns in weaving.</p>

<p>“It is not, then, the natives that you have to fear in regard
to your collections of plants; it is the weather, it is those heavy
showers that, unless protected with extreme care by waterproof
coverings, succeed in soaking your specimens and your drying
paper, so that you have occasionally to spend half the night in
some dirty hovel in doing what you can, by the aid of a large
fire, to save your collection from destruction. Still all the
difficulties and discomforts are far more than outweighed by
the pleasure you gain in the exercise, a pleasure which is enhanced
by the consciousness that you are probably the first that
has ever plucked the flowers from Nature’s bosom in that
particular locality, and that a large number of the specimens
will probably prove to be new to science.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">NESTS OF INSECTS</div>

<p>Although to anyone merely travelling through it, this upper
forest seems, especially in the cold season, to be singularly
deficient in animal life, yet to those who will carefully observe,
as they ramble through these woods, there are numerous small
living creatures well worth careful study. One cannot pass
many yards along a forest path without noticing here and there
a long white bag hanging on the trees and bushes. These vary
in length from about six inches to a foot, or even eighteen inches,
and are a long oval in shape; the upper part shines with a silky
lustre, and the whole would do so, but for its being filled at the
lower part with a mass of dark brown earthy substance, which
soils its purity. On cutting open the upper portion of the bag,
which is tough and strong, it is found to be filled with a mass
of brown caterpillars, about an inch and a half long, all wriggling
about when thus disturbed in their comfortable home. The
dark substance is evidently the droppings of these caterpillars;
and the opening at the lower end, sometimes small holes
around it, give exit and entrance, for generally two or three of
the insects are seen crawling on the outside. It would appear,
therefore, that this silken bag is the nest or home spun by the
caterpillars, a common habitation in which they undergo the
next change before becoming perfect insects. One always sees
that the branches near that on which the bag is suspended are
stripped of the leaves, no doubt by its inmates. I noticed that,
a day or two after I had cut open one of these bags, a thin film
of web had been spun over the opening, so as to close up the
entrance I had unceremoniously made into the privacy of the
little community.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANTS</div>

<p>No one can pass through the upper or lower forests without
noticing the much more prominent nests made in the trees by
another insect, a small species of black ant. These nests are
often as large as a football, and are apparently made of cow-dung,
or earthy and vegetable matter, forming a coarse papery
substance; they are peopled by large numbers of ants, and are
dark brown in colour. If one is procured—not an easy matter,
for the little inhabitants rush out and attack the intruder, and
dig their jaws into one’s flesh in a way to make one jump—it
will be seen, on cutting open the nest vertically, that there is a
series of thin floors about half-an-inch apart and supported by
pillars. The ants run about frantically, their chief care being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
to carry the white eggs and pupæ to a place of safety. But it
will be observed that in the nest there are to be seen a number
of very small but handsome beetles, perhaps in the proportion
of one to a hundred of the ants. What purpose do these entirely
different insects serve in the economy of ant life? It appears
that this is a fact observed in the nests of many other kinds of
ants, for the Rev. J. G. Wood, in his charming book, “Homes
without Hands,” says that above thirty species of beetle are
known as inhabiting ants’ nests. But he can throw no light
upon the purpose served by the presence of the beetles. Besides
these large and conspicuous nests, containing probably thousands
of ants, other nests, of all sizes, from about that of a nut
to an orange and upwards, may be seen: the hamlets, villages,
and small towns of the ant world, while the large nests are the
great cities of their commonwealth. The ants inhabiting these
dwellings appear to be all of one species, and about three-sixteenths
of an inch in length. What can these little creatures
live upon?—for they can hardly descend for it to the ground,
from heights of twenty, thirty, and even fifty or sixty, feet.</p>

<p>A very different kind of ants’ nest is seen in the more open
and sunny forest paths (and also in the bare interior country).
These have the form of a low circular mound, from eighteen
inches or more in diameter, and perhaps eight to ten inches
high, and have a large opening at the top—a miniature “crater.”
This mound consists of the fine grains of earth and sand brought
up and thrown out by the little workers in excavating their
subterraneous dwelling. These ants are larger insects than the
arboreal species; they are about three-eighths of an inch long,
and seem to exist in great numbers in their homes, the entrance
being like a crowded street, with passengers going to and fro.
They may be met with all round their nests, often at a considerable
distance from them, frequently tugging along pieces of
chewed sugar-cane, or portions of dead insects, enormous in size
compared with themselves. The ants are the scavengers of the
country; no beetle, or worm, or grub, or animal matter of any
kind, can be many minutes on the ground before it is detected by
some ant, which communicates the fact forthwith to its fellows,
and they immediately fall on the spoil, cut it in pieces and
convey it to their stronghold. It is astonishing to see the heavy
loads that two or three ants will stagger along with for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
common weal. Truly, although they are a small folk, they are
“exceeding wise.”</p>

<p>Another species of ant, which does not appear to construct
a nest, but inhabits the crevices and under the bark of trees,
is rather conspicuous from a large tuft or cushion of pale
brown velvet-like hairs on the upper side of the abdomen, and
a smaller one on the thorax. Its eggs and pupæ are carefully
hidden away under pieces of the bark which have become partly
detached.</p>

<p>On the top of the Ambàtovòry rock I found another and
smaller species of ant, about an eighth of an inch long. This ant
inhabits the dried flower-stalk of the <em>vàhona</em>, a small aloe
growing plentifully on the shallow soil close to rocks. On
breaking in two one of these stalks, the ants and a number of
pupæ fell out, long white cases, in which the dark body of the immature
insect could be seen. The little creatures seemed greatly
relieved to be able to gather up these precious pupæ, and they
soon collected them all, and brought them again into their
home. On examining the stalk I could see no entrance except
a minute hole, like a pinprick, at the top, just below where the
head of flowers had blossomed. It seems probable that the ants
find food in the pithy interior of these leaf-stalks.</p>

<p>In passing through the bush or the secondary forest, one
frequently sees the leaves of certain bushes withered and folded
up together. On opening one of such nests, it proves to be the
home of a species of beetle, a very handsome insect, about an
inch long, with a long slender thorax, and of a beautiful metallic-purple
colour. Enclosed in portions of the leaf are small green
caterpillars, and in others are chrysalides. A much smaller
beetle is also found in many of these nests. The edges of
the leaves appear as if sewn together at different places with
fine silk.</p>

<p>Although butterflies are scarce in these woods in the cold
season, caterpillars are numerous. Those making a large silken
bag have already been noticed; but there are others which
appear to be just now (in August) in a state of torpor. Here,
for instance, is a cluster of a dozen or so of brown caterpillars,
all clinging closely together around one another on the top
of a small twig. They seem perfectly motionless. Are they
hibernating? Here again is a collection of beautiful little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
caterpillars, about an inch long, of lovely pale green and bluish-green
colour, with markings of orange dots along the sides, and
four tufts of yellow hairs on head and tail. These are lying side
by side, half-a-dozen together on a leaf, and also appear perfectly
torpid, for they do not move for several days together.
Here again, on a leaf, are about thirty small caterpillars,
about five-eighths of an inch long. These are seen to be striped
with dark lines, like black velvet, with delicate markings and
spots of bright yellow. These insects, like those just
mentioned, are motionless and crowded together, as if for
warmth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WALKS FULL OF INTEREST</div>

<p>Walking slowly along, one notices a peculiar marking on a
twig; this on close inspection is seen to be an assemblage of the
eggs of some butterfly or moth, about a hundred of them, arranged
in four or five regular rows, pretty minute globes, light greyish-brown
in colour, with a minute black spot on the top, and
hardly one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter. In bushes and
small trees, somewhat unsightly little bundles of leaves are
sometimes very conspicuous. These are bound together with
an irregular mass of web; and cutting one of them open, it
is found to be full of the elytra of small beetles and the
chitinous portions of other insects, as well as leaves, forming
a closely compacted ball. This appears to be the work of a
small spider, which is generally found in some portion of the
nest.</p>

<p>There are many pleasant walks in different directions through
the woods, some of them merely woodcutters’ paths, and others
broader, where a palanquin can be taken. One cannot go far,
however, without having to go down steep descents and again
having a stiff climb; but the variety of leafage, the frequent
occurrence of some beautiful flower or bright-coloured berry
or fruit, or gay insect makes a walk full of interest; and when
we reach a high point there are extensive views over the undulating
masses of green foliage of very varied tints around
one, and the bare Ankay plain, with the distant lower forest,
twenty or thirty miles away, and fading into the distance north
and south.</p>

<p>Reptiles are not very conspicuous in these woods; one
seldom sees a snake, although probably the dense undergrowth
affords them sufficient concealment. In the outskirts of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
forest, however, and indeed all over Imèrina, a pretty snake,
from eighteen inches to two feet long, is frequently seen, dark
brown in colour, with fine white lines along its slender length.
The under side is white. Notwithstanding the innocuous
character of these little snakes, it is amusing to see the dread
the people have of them; our bearers, for instance, will leap
away from them as if they were treading on the sharpest
thorns. Some superstitious notions may partly account for
this fear, as one of the former chief idols of the Hova, called
Ramàhavàly (“the Avenger”), was supposed to be the patron
and lord of serpents. One sometimes sees a water-snake
swimming over the surface of a pond in a most graceful
fashion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIZARDS</div>

<p>Lizards are now and then seen; one is a large unpleasant-looking
creature, nearly two feet long, of which the tail is about
one foot. But a much smaller and prettier one is not uncommon,
with delicate markings. Other species, in the south-west region,
vary in length from six to nine inches. And here, on the fleshy
leaves of an aloe, we may see, basking in the hot sunshine, a
beautiful little bright green lizard, or darting over the surface
with such a rapid movement that it is difficult to observe it
closely. Its colour is so exactly like its habitat that it is doubtless
a “protective resemblance.” While staying at the sanatorium
in November 1899 a very curious arboreal lizard was brought
to us by some boys. This creature was clinging to a stick, and
at first sight, and until closely examined, I could not distinguish
it from the branch to which it clung. It was about six inches
long, the body was somewhat flattened, as well as the head, and
the eyes were large and bright. The feet were somewhat
webbed, the toes ending in small disks like those of the geckoes.
The tail was broad and flat, lying close to the branch, and
shaped something like that of a beaver. But the most interesting
point about this lizard was the wonderful resemblance
of its colouring to that of the bark of a tree. The minute scales
of the skin were mottled with brown, grey, green and white, so
as exactly to resemble tree bark, with the usual clothing of
lichens precisely the same in colour, together with small irregularities
of surface; so that until examined minutely, one could
hardly believe that the small patches of colour on the animal’s
skin were not also due to vegetable growths. It was difficult<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
at a few inches’ distance to see where the lizard began and the
wood ended; and in the forest it would be impossible to distinguish
it from the branch to which it clings. It proved, on
being sent to England, to form a new genus.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">CHAMELEONS</div>

<p>Chameleons are very frequently met with, not only in the
woods but also in the open country of Imèrina; and in our
gardens at the capital we often see them on the bushes or the
paths, from the little baby one of an inch long to the full-grown
one of six to eight inches. In the paths near the sanatorium one
may see them digging holes and depositing their eggs, which are
about the size of a small bean. Their colouring is often very
beautiful, with its shades of green and yellow and black, brown
and red markings, and there are certainly very rapid changes
of colour according to the different surroundings. The bright
tints they exhibit in sunshine and on leaves become dull dark
brown in the shade, or on dark coloured resting-places. Sometimes
they lose all colour, for I one day saw, on the path near the
woods, a chameleon in the coils of a small snake, which had
wound itself three times round the body and was apparently
preparing to swallow it, beginning at the head, although it
seemed almost impossible that the bulky body of the chameleon
could pass through so small an opening. And this was a curious
fact: the chameleon was perfectly <em>white</em>. From a sentimental
pity for the little creature, I unwound the snake from it and
placed it on a bush. It was apparently uninjured and soon
began to resume its ordinary colouring, of which its terror had
temporarily deprived it.</p>

<p>It is a noteworthy fact that Madagascar is one of the head-quarters
of the Chameleonidæ, for out of fifty known species
twenty-one at least are found in this island; and of the twenty-five
kinds which have been enumerated as having horns and
other remarkable processes on the head, no less than seventeen
are peculiar to this country. One species has a nose dilated
and toothed on each side; another has the top of the head
conically produced; while four species have two flat diverging
nasal prominences covered with large scutes; and in yet
another species, the single long conical appendage to the nose is
flexible. The largest Madagascar chameleon known is about
a foot long and is called Ramìlahèloka, which may perhaps be
(freely) translated, “Naughty old boy,” probably from its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
uncanny appearance and earthy colour; it is apparently always
found on the ground. Of this creature the natives assert that
anyone stepping on it, accidentally or otherwise, or seizing it,
becomes ill. From the slow, deliberate pace of the chameleon,
the Malagasy proverb advises foresight and retrospect:
“<em>Ataovy toy ny dìan-tàna</em>: <em>jerèo ny alòha, todìho ny aorìana</em>”—<em>i.e.</em>
“Act like the stepping of a chameleon: look where you are
going, look back the way you have come.” Naughty little
native boys are fond of making the male chameleons fight
together, and it is curious to see how widely the red mouth is
opened at such times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAND-SHELLS</div>

<p>While staying near the forest I occasionally saw and had
brought to me specimens of some of the land-shells which are
often found in damp places in the woods. Many years ago
more than two hundred of these were known, and this number
has probably been considerably added to since, and will still
be increased as the country becomes more perfectly explored.
Of non-operculate species about eighty were then described, of
operculate species about fifty, and about fifty forms had been
recorded from the lakes and rivers. The largest of these shells
is a species of <em>Helix</em> (<i>bicingulata</i>), warm brown in colour, with
diaper-like markings, flattish in shape, and three inches in its
longest diameter. There are several other smaller <em>helices</em>; also
examples of <i>Cyclostoma</i>, the opening of which, as the name
implies, is almost a perfect circle; species of <i>Ampullaria</i>, which
have a very large opening; <i>Stenogyra</i>, a long oval and spiral
shell; dark green <i>Melanatria</i>, a large spiral shell like <i>Turritella</i>,
three inches long, which I have gathered in forest streams;
while the most delicately marked shells are species of <i>Neritina</i>,
with black lines, like fine etchings, on a pale yellow ground.
Species of <i>Bultimus</i>, also a beautifully marked shell, and of
<i>Limnea</i>, <i>Physa</i>, <i>Phanorbis</i>, and many others are among the
fluviatile and terrestrial mollusca of Madagascar.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/p1361_ill.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Chameleon Minor.</span><br />

Madagascar is one of the head-quarters of the Chameleonidæ, for out of fifty known species
twenty-one at least are found in this island.</div>
</div>

<p>In walking through the woods one constantly comes across
traces of the wild boar, or, more properly, the river-hog (<i>Potamochærus
larvatus</i>), although the animal itself is rarely seen. It
is a somewhat ugly creature, with high withers, long back and
little hair. It has an enormous tubercle, supported by a bony
protuberance in the jaw, which renders the face of the animal
extremely disagreeable. It must exist in large numbers, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
it digs up the ground in search of roots and often does much
damage to plantations. The hunting of the wild boar is a
favourite sport with the Malagasy of certain districts, and
Europeans who have joined in the hunt have found it an exciting
sport, with a distinct element of danger, for the beast, when
infuriated, is a formidable animal from its long and powerful
tusks. Some naturalists are of opinion that there are two
distinct species of this river-hog, one found in the upper forest,
and the other on the coast and the lower forest region; of these,
the latter is the larger animal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUN-BIRDS</div>

<p>Turning now from boars to birds. Many of the Madagascar
birds are by no means deficient in the power of producing sweet
sounds of a very pleasing character and in considerable variety
of note; and there are some few whose song has even been
considered to resemble that of our European nightingale.
Although in the cold season there are comparatively few birds
seen or heard, yet it is not so in the warmer months, or in the
lower forest all through the year. Staying near the upper forest
in the month of December 1884, we sat down on the margin of a
stream, enjoying greatly the beauty of the woods and especially
the singing of the birds. Never before had I heard in a Madagascar
forest so many different notes, or so constant a sound of
bird life. Besides this, there was the low undertone of water
over the rapids some little distance away and the hum of insects.
It was a great enjoyment just to sit and listen, and see the birds
as they flew around us. Among these were the <em>Sòikèly</em>, a
species of sun-bird, a very little fellow, who sat on the topmost
point of a bare branch. There are three species of Nectarinidæ
found in the island, one of which, the glittering sickle-billed
sun-bird (<i>Neodrepanis coruscans</i>) belongs to a genus peculiar
to Madagascar. Many of the birds of this family rival, in the
Old World, the gem-like and metallic tints of the hummingbirds
of the New World, and this is true of those found here.
M. Pollen observes of them that they live in flocks, and all day
long one sees them darting about the flowering shrubs, sucking
with their long tongue the nectar which forms their principal
food. Their song is long, very agreeable, but little varied, and
they have the habit of suspending themselves by their claws
from the small branches. The male bird of one species has
metallic tints of purple, green, red and yellow. The other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
species is black underneath, with green and purple metallic
reflections on head, back and wings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROLLERS</div>

<p>Among the most beautiful birds in Madagascar are several
species of the rollers (<i>Coraciadæ</i>), so called from their peculiar
habit of flight. The five species found here live mostly on the
ground and come out chiefly at dusk. The <em>Vòrondrèo</em>, or
Kiròmbo roller, plays a great part in the chants and religious
recitations and folk-tales of the Malagasy. These birds live
chiefly on grasshoppers, but they also devour chameleons and
lizards. When they cry they puff out the throat, so that this
portion of the body has the appearance of a pendent bag. The
colouring of this species is perhaps the “quietest” of the five,
having a good deal of slaty-grey on head and breast. But both
it and its companions have shades of “shot” colour, purple and
green, or red and green, as looked at in different lights. The
others exhibit larger masses of bright colour; the violet roller
having, as its name denotes, a good deal of violet or purple
tinting. Four of them are rather large birds, but the scaly
ground roller is small, with a curious collar of black and white
feathers, reminding one of the strange neck and throat appendages
of some of the paradise birds.</p>

<p>Other birds we saw and heard that day were the <em>Railòvy</em>, a
species of shrike, with long forked tail; the <em>Bolòky</em>, or grey
parrot, with a long repeated whistle, as if going up the gamut;
the <em>Vòrondrèo</em>, one of the rollers, with its prolonged whistle
ending in a sudden drop; the <em>Parètika</em>, one of the warblers,
with a creaky little short note, something like a child’s rattle;
together with these sounds was the <em>kow-kow</em> of the <em>Kankàfotra</em>
cuckoo, the varied mellow notes of the <em>Tolòho</em> cuckoo, the
cooing sound of the <em>Fòny</em>, or wood-pigeon, and also the call of
one of the hawks.</p>


<div class="footnote">

<div class="sidenote">MR BARON</div>

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> Mr Baron was for thirty-five years a missionary of the
L.M.S. A good writer, an eloquent speaker, and an earnest
missionary, he was also a very able botanist and an accomplished
geologist, and at the time of his lamented death, in 1907,
he probably knew more about both these sciences, as regards
Madagascar, than any other European. On account of his
researches, and the large collections he made, he was elected
a Fellow of both the Linnæan and the Geological Societies,
honours never conferred except for substantial scientific work.
He also received a specially fitted microscope from the Royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
Society for petrological study, in which he became very proficient.
During his residence in Madagascar he sent home
many hundreds of plants, a great proportion of which were new
to science, and also a large number of rock sections for microscopical
and polariscope study. Twice he was offered valuable
positions under the French Government in this island, but he
was too true a missionary to give up Christian work.</p>

<span class="fs70">FOREST SCENES</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">ANYONE who has stayed near the upper forest during
December or January, and has quietly watched for
a short time among the trees, will not complain of
scarcity of bird life to admire and study. The beautiful
creatures will come and alight all around us, if we only remain
perfectly still, seeking their food as they hop on the ground, or
flutter from branch to branch. We may watch their nests and
see their eggs, and then the newly fledged birds, noting from
day to day how they develop; until one morning the nest is
empty, for its little inmates have found out their power of wing,
and have left it to set up for themselves and add another little
company to the tenants of the forests. It may be truly said
that the note of one bird or another is never silent at this time
of the year all day long, while some are heard also at night. I
remember especially watching one of the two species of goat-sucker,
which are found here: for although it is called <em>Matòriàndro</em>,
or “day-sleeper,” from its nocturnal habits, it may be
seen in shady places at midday; its beautifully mottled shades
of brown and grey giving it, no doubt, protection, from their
resemblance to its surroundings. They have the habit of rising
from a slight elevation straight into the air; then they let
themselves suddenly fall, to resume their ordinary mode of
flight. It will also fly along the paths, permitting one to
approach it again and again, and when flying it reveals the
black and white colouring under the wings. They feed exclusively
on nocturnal insects, chiefly moths and beetles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OWLS</div>

<p>While speaking of the birds of the interior, one must not
forget the owls, of which six or seven species are known in
Madagascar; two of these, the scops owl and the barn owl, are
tolerably plentiful. The last-mentioned appears to be exactly
identical with the almost world-wide and well-known bird of
that name. As among most other peoples, the owl is regarded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
by the Malagasy as a bird of ill-omen; they call it <em>Vòrondòlo</em>—<em>i.e.</em>
“spirit-bird”—thinking it an embodiment of the spirits of
the wicked; and when its startling screeching cry is heard in
the night they believe it to be a presage of misfortune. There
are numerous fables and stories about the owl, illustrating the
popular dread of the bird. But like the owls in all other parts
of the world, the Madagascar species are really public benefactors,
by keeping down the number of rats and mice and other
vermin; and yet their nocturnal habits, their large staring eyes,
the “uncanny” ear-like feathers of some, and especially their
unearthly screech, have all combined to make them objects of
dread. One species of owl is really a beautifully coloured bird,
its plumage being pale brown, spotted with silvery markings.</p>

<p>The bush and woods of small trees which are found surrounding
the upper belt of forest do not show many flowers during
the cold season of the year. Yet even during these cooler
months—May to August—innumerable objects of interest
present themselves to those who will use their eyes as they walk
along the woodland paths. Among the few flowers that are
to be seen, besides the ever-present orange spikes of the <em>Sèva</em>
(<i>Buddleia madagascariensis</i>), and the purple flowers of the
<em>Sèvabé</em> (<i>Solanum auriculatum</i>) are the bell-like reddish flowers of
a species of <i>Kitchingia</i>, which are rather plentiful; and towards
the end of August a number of small trees and bushes are
showing clusters of handsome crimson flowers; while a purple
trumpet-shaped flower is to be seen here and there. Not
uncommon is a shrub with small red flowers, like honeysuckle,
growing at the axils of the leaves and all along the stems. More
rare is a good-sized bush, with large light green and glossy
leaves, and with clusters of yellow fruits, much like large white
currants. This shrub would be a handsome addition to a
garden. Berries of various hues—black, red, orange and
yellow—are fairly plentiful; and in many bushes and trees
the lack of flowers is almost made up for by the brilliant scarlet,
or crimson, or orange colours of the new leaves, and in others
again by the bright orange or red of the fading leaves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PALMS</div>

<p>There are few trees of any size left in the woods in the immediate
vicinity of the sanatorium, or near the paths through
them; they have all been cut down for the timber market in
the capital, or for house-building in the nearer villages. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
in the deep valleys not a mile distant there is still much virgin
forest, and many trees of considerable height; and on the roadside
in the Mandràka valley, along which the automobile road
and then the railway have been constructed within the last ten
or twelve years, both cut through dense forest, there are many
lofty and isolated trees still left standing, as well as numbers of
them in the adjoining woods. Like most tropical trees, these
show the generally vertical habit of the branches; in the crowd
of competitors there is no room for lateral expansion by wide-spreading
branches; every tree presses upwards to get the
light and heat of the sun. In many parts of the forest, the
small palm, commonly called the “bamboo-palm” (<em>Mal.
Fàri-hàzo</em>—<em>i.e.</em> “woody sugar-cane”), is very plentiful, giving a
thoroughly tropical appearance to the vegetation. Few trees
are more beautiful than this palm, with its ringed stem, three
to four inches in diameter, and its graceful crown of light green
pinnate leaves, through which the sunlight shines. Its usual
height is twelve or fourteen feet, but it occasionally attains
double that height, or more, in certain situations. A much
larger, but far less common, palm is the <em>anìvona</em>, but this is
because of its being cut down for the sake of its tough wiry
bark, of which the people make the flooring of their houses, and
also use in the construction of the old-fashioned timber-framed
Hova dwellings. The bamboo-palm seems of much less
practical use, and is therefore much more plentiful. Here and
there a still smaller species of palm may be found, with a stem
not exceeding an inch in diameter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLIMBERS</div>

<p>A very noticeable feature of these woods, as indeed of all
tropical forests, is the profusion of climbing plants. Even the
smaller trees and bushes have their twining and creeping
parasites, tightly wound round their stems. And from the
tallest trees there hang and intertwine all manner of lianas,
some as big as a ship’s cable, and others of all intermediate sizes—ropes
of every dimension, down to the finest cord, and often
forming an almost impassable barrier, an inextricable tangle
of dense vegetation. Frequently these climbing plants seem
to strangle and squeeze out the life of their unfortunate hosts;
and it is often difficult to distinguish the foliage of the original
tree, and that of the parvenu, which has used its more robust
neighbour to climb up to the light and heat above the surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
mass of leafage. Some of these climbers have prominent
and beautiful flowers, which mark their presence very distinctly;
one of these, first sent home by a lady, proved to be a new
species. This liana is about as thick as a one-inch rope, and its
spikes of creamy-yellow flowers are set from one to two feet
apart on the main stem. These spikes are from ten to sixteen
inches in length, each containing from forty to sixty large
flowers growing closely together, so that they are very conspicuous
in the forest, forming immense festoons of flowers,
mounting to the tops of lofty trees, crossing from one tree to
another, and shining almost golden in colour in the brilliant
sunshine. These lianas are very plentiful and may be recognised
at a considerable distance, so that they form in November
one of the noticeable features of the upper line of forest. In the
cold season, during which many of these observations were
made, of course this liana is indistinguishable from the tangled
mass of vegetation.</p>

<p>Although during the winter months flowers, as already
mentioned, are scarce in the upper forest, there is very much
to interest one in the cryptogamic vegetation which is so
abundant everywhere around us. The mosses are seen in great
profusion, and of many species. Frequently they occur in
dense masses, carpeting the ground and the bases of the trees
with a thick cushion-like covering. And of what beautiful and
varied colours are these humble plants! light green and all
shades of darker green, star-like mosses of pale pink, browns
and greys, some bright crimson in colour, and some with waxy-looking
fructification stalks; and of all kinds of growth; hair-like
filaments, delicate branching forms, some thick like grass,
others like seaweeds, others silvery-white on one side and
chocolate-brown on the other; but words fail to give any
adequate idea of their variety and beauty. During a short
ramble a score of well-marked species may soon be gathered.</p>

<p>And the lichens are hardly less numerous or beautiful than
the mosses: indeed it is sometimes difficult to tell to which
order of plants some of these organisms belong. In many drier
places the ground is covered with masses of a pale grey species,
delicately branched. And almost everywhere the bushes and
trees are festooned with the hanging filaments of another pale
greyish-white lichen (<i>Usnea sp.</i>), which give them quite a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
venerable appearance. Another common species is a branching
coral-like one, pale green above, with beautiful shades of brown
underneath. The rocks seen all over Imèrina are sometimes
perfectly white with minute forms of lichen, but more frequently
present a mosaic of differently coloured species: black, white,
orange, russet and red.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FUNGI</div>

<p>And the fungi again are quite as noticeable as the other
cryptogams, and their colours make them even more conspicuous.
On decaying timber, their circular and collar-like forms
and bright tints constantly strike one’s attention. From one
inch to three or four inches in diameter these plants present
a great variety of colour; pure white, pale buff edged with
brown, brilliant scarlet, orange, yellow, dark brown, etc.; all
these are very common. Some fungi are hard and woody in
substance; others are leathery and flexible, others soft and
gelatinous; and occasionally one sees specimens a foot in
diameter, with delicate shades of browns and greys on their
upper surface.</p>

<p>It may be easily imagined that with this wealth and variety
of cryptogamic forms many of the tree trunks are a perfect
flora of the humbler kinds of vegetable growths; for we have
not mentioned the delicate hymenophyllum ferns which also
cover them in damp situations; or the great hart’s-tongue
ferns, which often occupy the forks of the branches; or the
innumerable small bulbs of the orchids, which cling, by their
long aerial roots, to the trunks and boughs of the trees.</p>

<p>In walking through the woods one sometimes becomes
conscious of a sickly sweet smell somewhere near us. This
proceeds from a hive of bees not very far away, generally in the
hollow of a tree. The honey, which is usually excellent, is
generally brought for sale to us in the comb by some of the
woodmen. Occasionally, however, it is somewhat bitter,
through being obtained from the flowers of certain trees or
plants. The Madagascar bee, known to entomologists as
<i>Apis unicolor</i>, differs but little in appearance from the English
species, although it is somewhat smaller, darker, and less
hardy. It chooses, if left to nature, the same kind of situation
for its hive, and multiplies in the same way. The drones also
are idle and are killed off at certain seasons. The Madagascar
insect is much more gentle when handled than the English one,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
but there is great difficulty in hiving the swarms. These bees
continue to store honey during the winter months, although
that is the dry season, with few flowers; and they work in all
weathers, even during a heavy thunderstorm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH’S-HEAD MOTH</div>

<p>The enemies of the Madagascar bee are, in the first place, rats,
then ants and the wax-moth; but the greatest enemy of all is
the death’s-head moth (<i>Sphinxatropos</i>), which is very common.
He enters the hive fearlessly, for although the bees crowd round
him they have no power to stop him, as their stings cannot
pierce that downy body, with its tough skin, but merely slip
along it harmlessly. As soon as he is within he keeps his wings
vibrating with a low humming noise and leisurely sucks his
fill—a very long fill. The damage he does is immense, and hives
have been known to be sucked dry, and not a drop of honey to
be found in them, so that the bees quite give up resisting.
Other enemies of the bee are a parasitical solitary wasp, which
lays its eggs in the hive; and another wasp which seizes the
bees when returning to the hive for the sake of their laden
honey-bag, and it also kills them with wonderful celerity.</p>

<p>The Malagasy have a good general idea of the economy of the
hive, and of the habits of the bees. They usually find the wild
nests by watching the flight of the laden bees, and then by
listening during the hot part of the day, when the bees are
“playing.” At most places the people know of a number of
wild nests, over which they keep supervision. In many
villages they make large quantities of mead, more especially
when the rite of circumcision is being observed. For bees’-wax
there is always a ready sale.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Madagascar, like most tropical countries, is not without a
fair share of spiny and prickly plants. Perhaps most in
evidence in the interior is the prickly pear (<i>Opuntia ferox</i>),
which was universally used in old times as a thick hedge for
the defence of the ancient towns and villages. With its large
needle-like spines, an inch to an inch and a half long, studding its
broad fleshy leaves, and capable of inflicting a wound difficult
to heal, and with smaller spines covering the flowers and the
fruit, it is easy to see that to a barefooted and lightly clothed
people such a hedge presented a very formidable, not to say
impassable, barrier. The flowers are large and handsome,
yellow and red in colour, and growing at the edge of the leaves—if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
indeed they can be called such; the fruit, which is about as
large as a pear, turns yellow when ripe and is not unpalatable,
being something like an unripe gooseberry; but it is exceedingly
difficult to get it peeled without being hurt by its hair-like
needles. The large spines are the ordinary Malagasy pins, and
are very useful for this purpose.</p>

<p>Another very noticeable plant is the <em>Sòngosòngo</em>, a species of
<i>Euphorbia</i>, with spiny stems and brilliant scarlet flowers. This
is planted on the top of the low earthen banks which form
the boundaries between private properties and the roads; but
it is not nearly such a formidable defence as the prickly pear.
A very common variety of this plant has pale yellow flowers.</p>

<p>Another prickly plant is the Mysore thorn, or <em>Tsiàfakòmby</em>
(<em>lit.</em> “impassable by cattle”), which is largely used for fences
and stockades. From its numerous hook-like thorns, it also
is not a plant which can be easily passed through, when growing
thickly. It has a large spike of yellow flowers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STINGING PLANTS</div>

<p>Another plant or shrub, which grows to the size of a tree, is
not prickly, but stinging. This is the <em>Amìana</em> (<i>Urera radula</i>).
The large velvety leaves sting like those of a nettle; they are,
however, of beautiful and complicated outline, and I have
pressed specimens taken from young plants which are as much
as two feet across, and which would be admirable patterns for
ornamentation. The wood is very soft and, when on fire,
smoulders for a long time. The trunk, which is tall and straight,
in some specimens is nearly two feet in diameter. Some five
different species have been described.</p>

<p>Another stinging plant, the <em>Agy</em>, with fine needle-like hairs,
which fall in showers and produce fearful irritation, is described
in a <a href="#CHAPTER_XXII">subsequent chapter</a>. Many trees in the forest are armed
with blunt prickles, which injure the hand if they are touched
when making one’s way through the dense vegetation. In the
extreme south of the island there are trees or shrubs called
<em>Fàntsi-òlotra</em> (“nail-edged”?), probably a species of <i>Didierea</i>,
whose thorny stems, always turned towards the south, are said
to resemble a barricade of elephants’ trunks; the stem, which
is as big as a man’s thigh, is entirely covered with large thorns,
between which grow the small round leaves. On one of these
thorny trees, however, M. Lemaire found a white lemur
(<i>Propithecus verrauxii</i>) clinging, which, when dislodged, went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
leaping across the country on its hind legs, after the fashion of a
kangaroo.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">FOREST DWELLERS</div>

<p>Someone may perhaps ask: Where are the people of these
woods? In the upper belt of forest there are few inhabitants
except woodcutters, and in small hamlets on the side of the
main tracks passing through it; but farther south, where the
two lines unite, we shall find, as we travel past the Bétsiléo
province and east of it, a considerable number of people, who
are loosely called “Tanàla,” which simply means “forest-dwellers,”
and of these there are many subdivisions. There
are vague and uncertain accounts given by the Malagasy of a
tribe of people whom they call Béhòsy, and who are said to live
in a wooded country in the west of the island. Their food is
honey, eels and lemurs, which latter are caught in traps and
fattened. They are very dark in colour and are much like the
Sàkalàva in appearance, and are said to jump from tree to tree
like monkeys, and cannot easily be followed, as the country is
rocky. They make network of cords, hence their name (<em>hòsy</em>,
string, twine). They are extremely timid, and, if captured, die
of fright. These Béhòsy seem to resemble in some of their
habits the “monkey-men” of Dourga Strait, New Guinea; but
it is much to be wished that more definite information could
be obtained about them, for, if what we hear of them is correct,
they are probably of a different stock to the rest of the
inhabitants of Madagascar.</p>

<p>An apparently well-authenticated account was given by a
Mauritius trader of a wild man of the woods having been
caught by some Malagasy in the year 1879. He was asleep on
the branch of a tree, and when taken resisted violently, biting
his captors severely; after a few days’ confinement, however, he
ceased to be aggressive. He was described as a powerfully
built man, his face and body being thickly covered with long
black hair. His mode of walking was very peculiar, as he
travelled very fast, occasionally going on all-fours, his eyes
being invariably fixed on the ground. When caught he was
perfectly nude, but wore clothes when provided with them. He
could never be induced to eat flesh, but lived entirely on manioc
and other roots; nor would he sleep in a recumbent position.
After some months he learned a few words, and by means of
these and signs it was understood that he had a father and two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
brothers in the forest. These were found, and surrounded by
a search-party one night, but easily eluded their pursuers,
jumping from tree to tree and running on all-fours. The
captured man died five months after being taken (see <cite>Proc.
Roy. Geogr. Soc.</cite>, May 1889).</p>

<div class="sidenote">CYCLONES</div>

<p>The central part of the Indian Ocean is well known as the
region of cyclones, and these dreaded storms often include in
their revolving course the islands of Mauritius and Réunion, and
occasionally touch the eastern shores of Madagascar. A notable
example of this was the cyclone of November 1912, which
stranded the S.S. <i>Salazie</i>, and wrecked Diego-Suarez and many
villages in the north of the island. It is very seldom, however,
that these storms reach the interior; but in the month of
February 1876 a cyclone did ascend to the upper region
of the island and did considerable damage. With my wife and
children I was staying for a holiday at that time at Andràngalòaka,
a small village on the edge of the upper forest, but five or
six miles south of Ankèramadìnika, where our good friend, Dr
A. Davidson, had a country house, which he often placed at the
disposal of ourselves and other friends; and never shall we
forget the experiences of that night of peril.</p>

<p>It was a Sunday evening and the sun set with a radiance which
covered the whole sky with a crimson glow, in a very remarkable
manner. We settled down after our evening meal for a little
reading aloud, but the wind rose rapidly, and after a time the
roar was so great that we could not go on. We found that its
violence increased, and at length we perceived that it was
slowly changing in its direction. We went to bed, but not to
sleep, for the rain poured in from the roof, and the howl of the
wind made sleep impossible. We lay trembling on our beds,
fearing every now and then, as a more violent burst shook the
house, that it would be blown down over us, and we buried in
its ruins. Such would have been the case, I believe, had not
the gables been built of burnt brick and strengthened by the
chimney-stacks. During the night the metal roofing of the
verandah was torn off with a fearful clatter, and soon after
dawn—and how long that dawn seemed in coming!—the outer
roof of the house, which was of grass, fixed over the tiled roof,
was bodily seized by the wind and carried off altogether with
its timbers, with a great crash, and then we thought the house<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
itself was all going. But towards nine <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the wind gradually
subsided, after having blown from about three-quarters of the
circle of the compass.</p>

<p>Scores of country chapels as well as houses were unroofed
and greatly damaged by this storm. A day or two after it we
tried to take one of our usual walks through the woods, but the
paths were almost obliterated by fallen trees and branches.
In the valleys scores of great trees had been torn up by the
roots, with masses of soil clinging to them; in other places they
had been broken off short, snapped as if they had been mere
twigs; and in the prostrate branches were numbers of arboreal
creatures—chameleons, lizards, serpents and tree-frogs—dashed
down from their homes. It was all striking evidence of the
force with which the fierce wind had roared, especially up the
valleys, and had laid low everything in its path.</p>

<span class="fs70">RAMBLES IN THE UPPER FOREST</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">THERE are a number of paths in the forest which may be
followed from the sanatorium, north, east and south,
and with a considerable variety of scene. But it is
easy to get lost in them, for I remember one day when a party
of us set out for a morning’s walk, but could not find our way
back, although we often caught sight of the house; and it was
late in the afternoon before we at length got home, very tired
and very hungry. Two of our friends, who were well acquainted
with the neighbourhood, were lost in paths not very far from
the sanatorium, and had to spend the night in the woods,
making as comfortable a resting-place as they could with
leaves and bracken, but getting no sleep from the multitude
of mosquitoes. And a curious circumstance was, that the
Malagasy from the house, who came out to seek for them, were
afraid either to shout out loud to them, or to show the lights
they carried, for fear of offending the <em>lòlo</em>, or spirits, which they
think haunt the woods. Had they done either of these things,
our friends would probably have escaped being benighted.
Happily, the time of this adventure was in the dry season, or
it might have had serious consequences.</p>

<p>From what has been said in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapters IV.</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_V">V.</a> about the
difficult paths through the chief forest, it is not strange that the
Malagasy have considerable dread of it and do not share in our
admiration of its beauties. So one of their proverbs says:
“<em>Roa lahy miditra ala: ka izy tokiko, ary izaho tokiny</em>”—that is,
“Two men entering the forest: it’s ‘He’s my confidence, and
I am his’”; the fact is that both are afraid. It is to them the
“dark forest,” full of mystery and fear, and it may easily be
imagined that before any practicable roads were made through
it, it had much to inspire dread. One of the native hymns,
often sung when the natives have friends going away to a
distance, prays for protection for them in the forest and also in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
crossing the rivers, on account of the many things in both
which may injure the traveller.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A MADAGASCAR FOREST</div>

<p>It would probably be a very serious matter for a European
to be lost for long in a Madagascar forest, for he would be
entirely at a loss for food, and would most likely be unable to
produce fire to cook anything he could find. To a Malagasy,
however, especially one living in the neighbourhood of the
woods, it would not matter so much, as there are several species
of yam, which he would easily find. These <em>Ovinàla</em> are climbing
plants common in the forest, belonging to the genus <i>Dioscorea</i>,
and have very large edible tubers, which are much sought after
by the people; their taste is similar to other yams which are so
largely used as food in other parts of the world. In Drury’s
“Adventures,” he speaks frequently of procuring these yams
in the south-western forests; for, living many years, as he did,
like a native in that part of the island, he became well versed
in woodcraft and could live as the people lived.</p>

<p>A European would be equally puzzled as to obtaining fire to
cook his yams, were he so fortunate as to find any; but a forest-dwelling
Malagasy could easily produce fire by friction. Choosing
two pieces of a particular kind of wood, he would cut one to
the shape of a round stick with a pointed end; the other he
would make into a flatter piece, in which a slight groove is cut.
Taking hold of the pointed stick, the operator twirls it first one
way and then another, until the friction produces smoke and
then fire, which is communicated to a little tinder placed close
to the point. Gently blowing upon the spark which is produced,
the tinder bursts into flame, the whole operation occupying only
a few minutes. There are special words for this mode of
obtaining fire: <em>mamòsitra</em>, which is also used for the boring
of a hole by an insect, or a chameleon, to deposit its eggs; and
<em>miraingy</em>, the pieces of wood being called <em>raingy</em>. But it may
be feared that the universal use of Swedish matches will soon
render this means of producing fire one of the lost arts.</p>

<p>To tend a fire is, in Malagasy, to <em>misòrona àfo</em>; and since
<em>misòrona</em> also means “to exercise a priestly function,” it looks
as if this word or phrase was a relic of ancient reverence for fire
as a sacred thing, a feeling which is found in the customs and
speech of many peoples.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WATERFALLS</div>

<p>In several directions there are beautiful waterfalls, to which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
a pleasant picnic excursion may be made. One of these is
called “Tsi-màharé-rìtsoka,” which means, “Where a whisper
cannot be heard,” for indeed, when near it, you must bawl as
loud as you can to be heard at all; this fall is a succession of
cascades, coming down from a considerable height. At another
place a large body of water pours at one sweep over a great ledge
of rock, perhaps thirty feet deep. And along the automobile
road, only a few yards from it up a little valley leading into
the main valley of the river Mandràka, we were fortunate one
day to discover a most lovely waterfall of considerable height
in the midst of dense wood, with a large pool of water at its foot,
where a delightful bathe might be taken; an ideal place for a
summer day. But the largest and grandest waterfall, and
within a little over an hour’s walk from the sanatorium, is
really an artificial one; for in making the automobile road to
Tamatave along the Mandràka valley, the river was diverted
from a circuitous course over a number of rapids, and brought
by a short-cutting over a nearly sheer fall of about a hundred
and fifty feet, where it pours down a magnificent body of water,
with a roar and clouds of spray that wet everything for a long
way round. The sides of the cutting are being rapidly covered
with vegetation from the constant moisture, so that in a short
time it will have all the effect of a natural fall. The noise is
tremendous, and the fall can be seen from several points on the
main road.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FROGS</div>

<p>At the foot of the second of the waterfalls just mentioned I
was fortunate enough to see a rather rare frog, which is peculiar
to Madagascar. This little creature is only an inch long, as
regards the body, but on that and its long hind legs there are
semicircular patches of bright red on a black ground, so that
it is very conspicuous (<i>Mantella baroni</i>) (see illustration).
There is also a much larger frog, three inches in length, with
hind legs quite six inches long (<i>Rhacophoras albilabris</i>); this
species appears to be, in part at least, arboreal as well as
aquatic, as its toes are furnished with little disks instead of
claws (see illustration). He is, however, a giant compared with
the majority of the frogs found in the island, which are not
very different in colouring or size from the common English
species. These creatures are very plentiful in the rice-fields,
and as one walks along the <em>vàlamparìa</em>, or little banks separating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
the fields, the frogs jump off and “plop” into the water at every
step one takes. In the early morning, after a rainy night, the
noise of their croaking is very loud, almost deafening, as they
apparently find the increased depth of water much to their liking.</p>

<p>From some small structural peculiarities, many of the Madagascar
frogs have been arranged in a distinct genus, called
<i>Mantidactylus</i>, and of this genus at least sixteen species have
been described. Of the widely distributed genus <i>Rana</i>, one
species, <i>R. fasciata</i>, is said by a careful observer to build a kind
of nest. These frogs construct regular passages under the
grass during the dry season; their paths are made as regularly
as those of a mole, by the little creatures pressing down the
short grass near the earth, and drawing together the longer
blades, thus rendering them invisible. The nests are from
eight to ten inches in diameter by four in height, and made
ingeniously by weaving the layers of grass together. When
frightened, these frogs throw out a limpid stream of water,
which has been stored up in time of need, as in very dry weather,
and which is distributed over the body, so as to keep the whole
of it moist. The tree-frogs are very pretty little creatures, their
light green colour exactly matching that of the leaves on which
they live, so that it is difficult to detect their presence, except by
close inspection. Their toes end in small disks, so as to adhere
closely to the smooth surface of the leaves.</p>

<p>We have already seen that many of the living creatures of
Madagascar gain great protection from enemies from the
assimilation of their colour to that of their surroundings. This
is the case also with many species of grasshopper and of mantis.
You see an insect with bright scarlet wings flit by you and settle
on a bush; wanting to observe it more closely, you try to find
it, but it has disappeared, and not a vestige of bright colour is
to be seen. Still, if you are patient and search carefully, you
may presently see a mantis moving its head about in an uncanny
fashion, and its fore legs held up in a mock devotional attitude,
from which its specific name of <i>Religiosa</i> has been given it. But
the scarlet wings are folded under its green wing-cases so as to
be perfectly unseen, and these coverings are just like a leaf, the
rest of its body being exactly the colour of its resting-place. In
some of the grasshoppers, this mimicry of vegetable forms is
still more wonderful. Here is one which resembles <em>green</em> grass,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
and its body, legs, wing-sheaths and antennæ are all as like
grass as they can possibly be. But here again is another kind,
whose body is equally imitative of <em>dry</em> grass, and so all parts of
it are just like the stalks or the blades of yellowish-brown grass,
dried up during the cold season. Even the eyes are imitative,
and exactly resemble a small brown seed, such as many grasses
bear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BEETLES</div>

<p>There are many species of beetles to be seen, although none
of them are very handsome or conspicuous. The most common
kind is a broad flat insect, about an inch long and dull dark
brown in colour, which crosses one’s path at every step. Another
is seen chiefly on the bushes, a smaller insect, but bright shining
jet-black. Another, which appears as if it mimicked a wasp in
its habit of flight, is shot with brown and green, with very long
legs, and is constantly taking short flights or running rapidly.
Another one, but much more rare, has golden-green and metallic
tints on its wing-cases. But the insect which has puzzled us
most is one that I have seen on a large bush of <em>Ròimémy</em>, a plant
with acacia-like leaves, with prickles along the leaf-stalks.
This beetle is about five-eighths of an inch long, and almost
hemispherical in shape. It is warm reddish-brown in colour,
with a line of black and then of yellow next the head, and is
perfectly flat below. These insects cluster closely, as thick as
they can lie, in groups of from a dozen to more than a hundred
together, all round the thicker stems, so that they look at a
little distance like strings of large brown beads; and in some
of the topmost branches they form a continuous mass for two
or three feet. Amongst these shining brown insects are a few
others of quite a different colour and shape, perfectly flat, like a
minute tortoise, and of a uniform grey, exactly resembling the
lichen on the bark of the tree, and the edges of the carapace
scalloped. These grey insects are in the proportion of about
one to forty or fifty of the darker coloured ones. There are
also a few individuals of the same shape as the brown one, but
yellowish-green in colour. What these grey insects can be, and
what relation they bear to the much more numerous brown ones,
I cannot make out.</p>

<p>Other insects, at first sight resembling beetles, are gaudily
coloured. Yonder is a bush which is conspicuous from some
little distance, from the quantity of insects clustered on it;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
they are about half-an-inch long, but are most brilliant with
scarlet, blue and green. Be careful, however, how you handle
them, for their scent is anything but agreeable; and, notwithstanding
their gay colours, they are, after all, a species of bug.
A beetle which I have often noticed in the woods is an insect
an inch and a half long, but with a very long slender proboscis,
with which it appears to pierce the bark of the stems on which
it rests; I think it feeds on the juices of the bush or tree, and
is probably a species of weevil (<i>Eupholus sp?</i>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">MIMICRY</div>

<p>Mimicry, however, is not confined to Madagascar animals, but
also occurs among plants. Mr Baron says: “In some marshy
ground on the top of Ankàratra mountain, I found a small
whitish orchid, a few specimens of which I gathered. After
getting about half-a-dozen, I discovered, to my great surprise,
that some of them were labiate plants. I was utterly deceived,
thinking it was the same plant I was gathering all the time, so
exactly alike were the two species in almost all outward appearances.
I felt at once convinced that this was a case of mimicry.
At the east foot of the mountain I discovered a similar phenomenon,
in a large labiate plant (<i>Salvia</i>), strikingly similar to
another orchid. No doubt the labiate in each case mimics the
orchid, not vice versa, in order to ensure fertilisation.”</p>

<p>In one of our rambles near the large patch of old forest which
still remains near the L.M.S. sanatorium at Ambàtovòry I
came one day across a cluster of very large earthworms; at
first sight these looked more like a number of small snakes than
worms, as they were at least three times the size of any English
worms, having about as large a diameter as a good-sized man’s
finger. They are not, however, very common, as I have only
seen them on that one occasion; so they probably do not play
the same important part in the renewal of the soil here as Mr
Darwin has shown is done by earthworms in Europe.</p>

<p>Anyone who walks through the forest will notice at points
where the paths branch off a pile of bracken, branches of trees,
moss, etc. These heaps, as well as those of stones in similar
positions in the open country, are known as <em>fànataovana</em>. These
have been formed by passers-by throwing a stick or stone on the
heap, for luck, expressing the hope that, if on a journey, they
may have a safe return, as well as success in their undertakings.
A similar custom prevails in the eastern parts of Africa, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
also in Sumatra and Timor, and probably in other countries as
well.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NATIVE FOUNDRIES</div>

<p>A walk along the upper edge of the forest, although at some
distance from Ankèramadìnika, will bring us to one of the
native smelting and forging stations, where iron is obtained
and made into pigs for the use of blacksmiths, as well as into
various implements. Iron is very abundant in the interior of
Madagascar, indeed the whole soil over an immense extent of it
is reddened by iron oxide, and in some places there is so much
magnetite that a compass is seriously deflected and is quite
unreliable. At such a foundry one may see in use the “feather-bellows,”
which the Malagasy brought with them from their
far-off Malayan home, and which I believe is nowhere to be
found but in Madagascar and Malaysia. This consists of two
cylinders, about five feet long and six inches to eight inches
wide, made from the trunks of trees hollowed out. These are
made air-tight at the lower end and fixed in the earth in a
vertical position, about eighteen inches to two feet apart. In
each cylinder a hole is made a few inches from the ground, and
in these a bamboo cane or an old musket-barrel is inserted, the
other end being fixed into the stone or clay wall of the furnace.
A piston with feather valves is fitted into each cylinder, and
the shafts or piston-rods are worked up and down alternately
by a boy or man seated on a board uniting the cylinders. In
this way a continuous blast is produced in the furnace. (Such
bellows are also used by blacksmiths.)</p>

<p>These foundries are always situated near a running stream of
water, so that the ore may be washed and cleared as much as
possible from earth and sand. The furnace itself is a hole about
six feet in diameter and one or two feet deep; its walls are of
rough stonework, built up three or four feet, and thickly
plastered outside with clay. Charcoal is used in smelting and,
notwithstanding these rude appliances and methods, the iron
produced has been pronounced by competent judges to be of
excellent quality. Spade-blades, knives, nails, bolts and many
other articles are produced by the native smiths; and in the
construction of the Memorial Churches, more than forty years
ago, I had ornamental hinges, railings, finial crosses, and other
requisite ironwork all excellently made and finished by Malagasy
blacksmiths.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>Several of the paths in the forest lead down into ravines of
considerable depth and also of great beauty; the combinations
of luxuriant foliage, rushing water and lichen-embroidered
rocks, ferns and mosses are very varied, and one valley especially
reminds one of the celebrated “Fairy Glen” in North
Wales. But there are occasionally certain drawbacks even in
this natural loveliness, for if you are not very careful you may
find yourself attacked by the small leeches which lie in wait on
the grass and bushes, and transfer themselves to you as you
brush by them. Before you feel any annoyance, you may find
yourself streaming with blood from the punctures made by
these little pests, which have got under your clothing and are
feeding at your expense. Happily, they do not cause any pain
worth speaking of, nor are there any unpleasant after-effects, the
only discomfort is the blood you lose and having it outside
instead of inside your skin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CRAYFISH</div>

<p>While staying near the upper forest we had frequently
brought to us for sale a basketful of crayfish, which seems
fairly plentiful in the streams. This species (<i>Astacoides madagascariensis</i>),
with its genus, is endemic in Madagascar, and
in the interior is of small size, averaging about three inches in
length; the flavour, however, is excellent, and it makes a very
good curry. In the south-east provinces, and probably in other
coast districts as well, it attains larger dimensions than the
above, being about six inches long. It is a curious fact that
crustaceans are entirely absent in the African continent, and
that the Madagascar species is much like the kind found in
Australia, except that the latter is about twice the size of
<i>Astacoides</i>.</p>

<p>There is a great variety of ferns to be found in every damp
place in the valleys, from the minute hymenophyllums on the
tree trunks to the larger species of Asplenium, Osmunda, Nephrodium
and many others, up to the tree-ferns, of which there are
about twenty different kinds, and which give a special charm to
the vegetation in many places. On the eastern side of Madagascar
the ferns occupy a prominent place in the flora, there
being above two hundred species already known, and comprising
no less than above thirteen per cent. of the whole flora of that
region. Among the Filici are the beautiful gold ferns and silver
ferns, the seed-vessels on the under side of the fronds having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
quite the effect of the two precious metals. The young leaves
of a tree found in the forest (<i>Eleocarpus sericeus</i>), when dried
and pressed, form the beautiful objects known as “gold leaves.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">VALUABLE TREES</div>

<p>A large number of the forest trees yield substances of commercial
value. Two species of climbing plants afford india-rubber,
one of the most valuable exports of the island. A tree
called Nàto supplies a bark which is largely employed by the
natives in dyeing the deep red used for their silk <em>làmbas</em>, especially
those used to wrap the bodies of the dead. Other trees
yield various gums and resins, one of these being the valuable
gum-copal, of which quantities are exported. From several
other trees tough fibres are obtained for the manufacture of
cord and rope; while from a palm called Vònitra the “bass
fibre” or piassava is taken, which is used for making brooms,
brushes, etc. A shrub, a species of castor-oil plant, supplies
seeds which are so full of oil or fat that they are strung on a reed
like beads and are used to give light, so that it is called “the
candle-nut tree.” When one end is lit, the seeds burn steadily,
giving a light about equal to that of two good candles and
leaving no ash. A very considerable number of trees and
plants are employed in various ways by the Malagasy as medicine,
both for internal and external use; and although the
virtue of some of these may be imaginative only, there can be
little doubt that in numbers of instances these native remedies
are of value. Probably a careful examination of them would
give some valuable additions to the pharmacopœia.</p>

<p>Among the forest trees is a considerable number which yield
valuable timber, most of them hard and beautifully grained
woods, which are employed for cabinet-work as well as in house
carpentry. In the great palace at Antanànarìvo, the three
central columns supporting the ridge of the roof are said to be
each formed of the trunk of a single tree; the roof is a hundred
and twenty feet high, and these pillars are sunk some way in
the earth. One of these timber trees, called <em>Vòambòana</em>, is
extensively used for making furniture—tables, sideboards,
wardrobes, writing-desks, bookshelves, etc.—and resembles
mahogany. Another tree called <em>Hàrahàra</em> has extremely hard
wood, and is employed for the long spade handles, and formerly
for spear shafts. One species of pine known as <em>Hètatra</em>, the
only example of that order in the island, gives a hard white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
wood used for flooring; while ebony is procured from one or
two endemic species of <i>Diospyros</i>; sandalwood is also reported
to be found in certain localities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUPERSTITIONS</div>

<p>It will easily be believed that the mysteriousness of the
forest has produced many superstitious notions among the
Malagasy, and they have curious stories of marvellous creatures
and monsters inhabiting these dense woods. One of these is
called <em>Kinòly</em>, and is said to be human in origin, for although it
has no intestines or stomach, yet in all its other parts it is like
a living person. Its eyes are red, and its nails long; and, with
others of its kind, it is said to be constantly thieving, so that
when anyone leaves out cooked rice or other food, it takes it.
It is difficult, however, to reconcile such accounts with that of
their bowelless condition; it is thought to be a great misfortune
to meet a kinòly. Another strange creature is called <em>Tòkan-tòngotra</em>,
or “Single foot,” because it is said to have only one
fore and one hind leg! It is so exceedingly swift that no other
creature has a chance of escaping it; it eats men and goes about
at night. Still another strange beast is called <em>Siòna</em>, which has
also, like the kinòly, something human about it. It is said to
live away from men, and when anyone goes through the woods
and leaves his rice, or his axe, these are taken by the siòna and
conveyed to its abode. When the woodmen go to sleep and
leave a fire still burning (for their custom is to leave a big log on
the hearth, so that they may be kept warm), then this creature
comes and warms itself. Possibly the habits of some of the
larger lemurs have given rise to such stories, aided by a good
deal of imagination; and the tòkan-tòngotra story probably
comes from the herons or flamingoes, which have the habit of
standing on one leg when asleep.</p>

<p>In passing along the forest paths we frequently come across
examples of the curious ball-insect (<i>Spherotherium sp.</i>), of which
there are several species, at least six, in Madagascar. These
insects, which are wingless and many-footed, and are called,
not very elegantly, by the Malagasy <em>Tainkìntana</em>, or “Star-droppings,”
have the power of instantaneously rolling themselves
into an almost perfect sphere, which form they retain as
long as any danger threatens them, and no force short of pulling
them to pieces can make them unroll. The animal is formed of
nine or ten segments, each with a pair of legs and covered with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
a plate of armour; while the head and tail are defended by
larger plates, each of which fits into the other and makes a more
perfectly fitting suit of armour than was ever worn by medieval
knight. There are several species of these pretty and curious
creatures. The most common kind here is one which forms a
ball barely an inch in diameter and shining black in colour.
Another, more rarely seen in the interior open country, but
common enough in the upper belt of forest, is of a beautiful
brown colour like russia leather, and is quite double the size of
the first-mentioned one. In passing through the main forest in
1892, we came suddenly one day to a part of the road which
was so thickly covered by such a great number of these creatures
that our bearers could not avoid trampling on them. These
were of a bronze-green tint and belong to a third species, and
were quite three inches in length. Other species of these
Sphærotheria are found in Africa, Asia, Australia and some of
the neighbouring islands.</p>

<p>Another many-footed and wingless creature is common
enough in the upper forest, for we often found it on the upper
verandah of the house at Andràngalòaka; this is a shining
black millipede, about a foot in length, and half to three-quarters
of an inch in thickness. It is called by the natives <em>Kòdikòdy</em>,
and its numerous reddish legs, not far short of a thousand in
number, have a curious effect of successive waves as it moves
along. Although not very inviting in appearance, it is quite
harmless and is a vegetable feeder. There is another species,
which is marked longitudinally with black and red stripes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CENTIPEDES</div>

<div class="sidenote">SCORPIONS</div>

<p>More unpleasant by far is another many-legged creature, the
centipede, whose sting is said to be exceedingly painful,
resembling the puncture of a hot iron, and which is not uncommon
in the interior as well as in the forest. The mere
touch of its minute claws, if it happens to crawl over one, is said
to produce pain and inflammation. I have turned small
centipedes out of the hole in a window-sill where the bolt would
fall; and I remember one morning, before getting out of bed,
seeing a pretty large one marching across our bedroom floor.
Happily these, which are among the few noxious creatures we
have in Madagascar, are not very common. Another unpleasant
visitor is the scorpion, which is rather apt to get into
a house which has much stonework in the basement; we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
frequently killed small ones about an inch long at Antanànarìvo.
Examples twice that size are found in the Vàvavàto district;
while on the shores of Bèmbatòka Bay (N.W.Co.) scorpions
five inches long occur, and Captain Owen says that they may
be found, one or more, under almost every stone. He states
a curious fact, if indeed it is one—viz. that the most destructive
enemy to the scorpion is the common mouse.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> Here I may notice that, in addition to the above-named
unpleasant inhabitants of Madagascar, we have had, within
the last eighteen years, a most unwelcome accession to the
insect pests, by the introduction of the chigoe, or “jigger,”
which was brought by the Senegalese black troops employed in
the French conquest of 1895. This minute flea does not jump,
but runs over one’s body, and burrows under the skin, chiefly in
the feet, but also sometimes in the hands, where it causes
intolerable itching, and, if not speedily removed with a needle,
becomes in four or five days full of eggs, and causes sores and
inflammation. It is a great pest to the Malagasy, the great
majority of whom go barefoot. But those who have boots and
shoes on get no exemption from the attacks of the jiggers.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-capy">WHILE on the subject of noxious creatures, we
remember that one, if not more, of the spiders of
Madagascar must be included in the list. This is a
small arachnid, about the size and shape of a marble, shining
glossy black in colour, except for a small red spot on the
fundament. It is greatly dreaded by the natives, who believe
its bite to be fatal, and it is probably so if cauterisation and
other remedies are not immediately applied. Dr Vinson, a
French naturalist, ascertained that this spider, called <em>Mènavòdy</em>
by the people, is closely allied to the malignant <i>Latrodectus</i> of
Elba and Corsica, whose bite is believed to be fatal, and also
to another spider found in Martinique, which is equally
dangerous. People bitten by this Madagascar spider scream
out with pain at intervals of a minute or two, as if it came
on in paroxysms. I remember that one of our servants when
bringing one of these spiders to look at took care to hold it
at a very respectful distance from himself, at the end of a
long stick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPIDERS</div>

<p>As we push through the bushes we break through many
spiders’ webs, and are struck by the extraordinary shape of
some of those whose snares we unwittingly destroy by our
passing along. Here is one, small and reddish in colour, but
much broader than it is long, each side projecting into a long
sharp spike—indeed it is spiky in several directions, and is
utterly unlike any other spider we know of. This is, I believe,
a species of <i>Cærostris</i> (<i>C. stygiana?</i>), and belongs to a genus of
which several species have names denoting their demoniacal
shape and colouring—<em>e.g.</em> <i>avernalis</i>, <i>stygiana</i>, etc.</p>

<p>As we stop to observe his geometric web, and his bizarre
shape, we see on the tree to which several of his main “guys”
are fixed a very different spider’s house and a very different
spider from our angular friend just mentioned. This creature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
is a much larger species than the other, with jet-black legs and
satiny dark grey abdomen as large as a good-sized nut. He
apparently hunts his prey, for he has no net, but hides himself
in an inverted cup-shaped house of strong web. As I tap the
top of this retreat he shams dead and tumbles down into the
grass, from which he will presently ascend as soon as the enemy
is clear off the ground.</p>

<p>Close by this hunting spider’s home we see the large web of a
third species, quite different from the other two. At first sight
this appears to be the same insect as the large <i>Nephila</i>, which
is so plentiful in Imèrina, in orchards and outside houses. A
closer inspection, however, shows that it is a different species
from that common large spider, for this one has a long filbert-shaped
abdomen, striped with brown lines, very different from
the golden and silvery markings of the more abundant species.
It appears to be strictly a forest spider and seems rather
rare.</p>

<p>In rambling along the edge of one of the pretty rice-valleys
north of Ambòhimànga, I came across a species I had not met
with before. This was of medium size, but was striped in
transverse lines of white and black across the abdomen, so as
to give it a zebra-like appearance. The under side was almost
white; altogether it is a handsome species, and is probably
still undescribed scientifically. It makes a geometrical web,
and, like several other Madagascar spiders, puts the web into
rapid vibration if it is disturbed. Some species draw up their
legs close to the body when lying in wait in the centre of their
web, so that they too resemble a small lump of earth or a stone.
Is not this also done as a disguise? It seems to me highly
probable. Other species have the habit of stretching out their
legs in couples, so as to seem almost as if they had only four or
six legs instead of eight, and thus appear to mimic insects. Is
this also intended to hide their predaceous character?</p>

<p>A traveller through the Tanòsy country, south-east coast,
speaks of the uncanny aspect of one of the villages in which he
stayed; and he says that what increased his impression of it, as
like a town of wicked enchanters, was that all the houses were
festooned and closely linked together overhead by tangled masses
of gigantic spiders’ webs, amongst which lay in wait monstrous
black spiders. Some of the coast villages, he says, were almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
completely roofed in by these great webs. Spaces of quite
thirty feet have been observed spanned by the lines of the
nephila mentioned in a <a href="#neph">former chapter</a>; and I have noticed
that the angles and outer spaces of its great web are frequently
filled up by the minute geometric webs of smaller species.
These lesser fry appear to be tolerated, if not encouraged, by
their giant neighbour, as they probably catch what would be
insignificant to her, and very likely clear her web of what she
rejects; and so they all live together in harmony in a small
colony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROTECTIVE RESEMBLANCE</div>

<p>Looking about in the undergrowth for wild flowers and fruit,
and happening to rub against the stem of one of the bushes, a
small rough roundish ball falls off on to the ground; this appears
exactly like a bit of round wrinkled bark, but on watching
for a minute or two, it develops four pairs of legs, and runs
nimbly away under cover, revealing itself as a spider, with a
marvellous protective resemblance to its surroundings. Unless
the creature actually moves, it is impossible to detect it, it is
so exactly like a knobby bit of the brown bark.</p>

<p>Protective resemblance in quite a different style appears in
a small spider, perfectly white in colour—thorax, legs and
abdomen—which scuttles out of the coralla of certain white
flowers when these are examined or shaken. This also, unless
it moves, is all but invisible; and there can be no doubt that
it is thus enabled to catch the many small flies which are
attracted by the honey and fragrance of the flowers. A larger
and green spider, a handsome species, with a long oval abdomen
striped with red, probably also a hunter, thanks to its close
resemblance to green leaves and the pale reddish veining seen
on many leaves, by which it is thus protected from observation
until it can pounce upon its prey. This is one species of the
many spiders which are caught by some of the solitary wasps, as
described in <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII.</a></p>

<p>As we notice these curious disguises in spiders, as well as in
numbers of other living creatures, we are reminded of the old
nursery tales and fables of the gift of invisibility supposed to be
conferred by certain plants, or by certain charms or ceremonies.
With these spiders, as well as in many other creatures, some
lower, and others much higher, than them in organisation, this
power of becoming at will unseen, even under the closest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
observation, is no fable, but a veritable fact. There is a
curious habit which I have observed in several species of Malagasy
spiders which is apparently also used for protection. If
they are disturbed, or if their web is shaken, they immediately
throw themselves into a state of violent vibration, so that the
eye cannot follow them; and this rapid motion is continued for
two or three minutes, until the supposed danger has passed
away. It would seem as if this must be done to confuse a
possible enemy intending to attack them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VENOMOUS SPIDERS</div>

<p>Besides the red-spot spider, there is another kind called by the
natives <em>Fòka</em>; this is rather common in gardens and is extremely
like a small crab, with a lozenge-shaped abdomen; it is covered
with tubercles, and its legs are roughened, like those of a crustacean.
Its bite is followed by swelling, which spreads from
the wounded part through the whole body. This dangerous
spider’s bite is said to be often fatal. There is another spider,
apparently a species of <i>Mygale</i>, called by the people <em>Tàrabìby</em>,
found fifty to sixty miles west of the capital, whose bite is also
said to be dangerous, if not actually fatal. It appears to be a
trap-door species. Besides this one, another species of trap-door
spider is also said to be found in Imèrina, but I have not
seen a specimen myself; it is said to leave the door of its
dwelling open.</p>

<p>The illustration given herewith will give a better idea than
any mere description can of the strange shapes of many
Madagascar spiders. The largest figure shows an <i>Epeira</i> of
extraordinary shape; it will be seen that the abdomen is like
a set of three cones, fixed into one another and terminated by a
sharpish point. A still more bizarre figure is presented by
<i>Epeira mitralis</i>, as it crouches, fixed close to a branch or twig;
whether viewed from the back or front or side, it is equally
“uncanny” in its appearance. Then, again, the two <i>Gastera-canthæ</i>,
with their bodies much broader than they are long, are
very unlike our ordinary idea of a spider, while the formidable
spikes with which they are armed would appear a very efficient
protection from any insect-eating bird or beast. The rather
diabolical-looking <i>Thomisus foka</i>, with its crab-like pincers, is
much dreaded by the Malagasy, as giving a fatal bite, if speedy
remedies are not applied. Happily, it is not very common.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIFFERENT SPECIES OF SPIDERS</div>

<p>There is a considerable variety in the webs of Malagasy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
spiders. Here is one which may be seen by hundreds, filling
up the space between the sharp-pointed leaves of the aloes. At
first sight it appears only a tangled mass of web, but on closer
examination we see that the groundwork is a geometrical web
in the centre, but as it is stretched horizontally, and not vertically,
it is cup-shaped. But from it, above and below, stretches
a labyrinth of lines, like the crossing and recrossing of the
lianas in the forest. In the centre of this maze of lines the
owner of the structure lies in wait, a small spider, handsomely
marked with black and white. Not far off a grey silken bag is
hung, which contains the eggs, from which a swarm of little
spiders will eventually proceed, not bigger than small ants.</p>

<p>A word or two may be added about a very common house
spider which is abundant in Imèrina. This is a rather large
species, light brown in colour, but its peculiarity is that it is
extremely thin and flat—a case almost of extension without
thickness, as it is hardly thicker than a piece of stout paper;
and so it is enabled to wait for its prey hidden in narrow and
almost imperceptible cracks. It is emphatically a hunting
spider and makes apparently no nest or web, and it is amusing
to see the adroit way in which it will cautiously approach the
edge of a crack in a board and sweep off an unwary fly.</p>

<p>One more curious spider may be noticed here; this has a very
small body, hardly larger than a big pin’s head, but it has
extraordinarily long thread-like legs, covering a very wide area
when compared with its minute body.</p>

<p>There must be still a large number of these Arachnidæ yet
unknown to science, for they are very numerous in species in
some localities. I remember spending an afternoon, many
years ago, on a hill a few miles south of the capital, together
with two or three friends, hunting spiders. We caught at least
thirty different species among the bushes on the hill-top and
slopes. Doubtless some of these are described and figured in
one of the volumes of M. Grandidier’s great work on Madagascar,
still in progress. But there are probably a much larger number
of these creatures still awaiting the careful observations of anyone
who will note their interesting habits and homes, and their
very varied appearance and structure.</p>

</div>

<p>I fancy my readers will now say, you have told us a good deal
about the insects, and something about the reptiles and birds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
of the forest, but are there no four-footed animals in the Madagascar
woods except the wild boar? Yes, there certainly are
many such, for there are at least fifty species of quadrupeds
already known in addition to the lemurs; but as they are, most
of them, small—sixteen are species of rats and mice, and
twenty-three are a kind of hedgehog, and therefore are burrowing
animals—they are not at all conspicuous and must be
sought for if we want to observe their habits; and the ten
species of carnivora are also mostly small in size. Leaving for
the present the carnivora and the rodentia, let me say here
what can be said of interest about a group of small animals
which are in habit and appearance much like the European
hedgehogs, being of the same order (the insect-eaters), but
belonging to a distinct family, the Centetidæ, which, except
for one genus, are peculiar to Madagascar. Some of these
animals have a covering of strong spines, while in other species
this consists rather of firm prickly hairs, which, however, do
not cover the whole of the body. The larger kinds, called
<em>Tràndraka</em> by the Malagasy, are used by them for food, and
have very much the taste of pork. (I have eaten them once
or twice, but they are rather rich and greasy.) They are found
in the woods, but especially in the scattered brushwood in the
vicinity of the forests; and we occasionally met with two or
three varieties of these harmless creatures while rambling in the
outskirts of the woods. Our dog often chased and attempted
to worry them, but she usually came back with her mouth and
nose stuck full of prickles and looking like a pincushion, and
apparently very uncomfortable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TAIL-LESS TENREC</div>

<p>The tail-less tenrec (<i>Centetes ecaudatus</i>) is the largest and
best known of its family. Its manner of life is remarkable, for
it passes half the year, the cold season, in a profound sleep, in
a burrow which it excavates about May or June. The female
is very prolific, bringing forth from twelve to twenty-two
young ones, which are bravely defended by the mother against
every enemy. Their food consists chiefly of earthworms, and
also of roots, fruits and insects. They sleep almost constantly
during the day, while they are very active during the night;
and what has been here said of the <em>Tràndraka</em> as to habits, food,
etc., may be taken as representing what might be said of most
of the Centetidæ. The striped tenrec is about the size of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
mole, and is streaked with black and yellow, as are indeed the
young of other species. The spiny tenrec is much like our
European hedgehog, as it is covered with strong spines, and can
roll itself up into a ball when attacked. Another species,
called <em>Sòra</em> by the natives, is about five inches long. A female
of this kind was one day brought to us for sale, together with
eight or nine tiny young ones only a few days old. These were
prettily banded with yellow and brown stripes, their hair being
still soft. They were about the size of a large egg, and a most
curious little family of creatures they looked. The rice tenrec
inhabits the plains between the two lines of forest, and does
immense injury to the rice crops by burrowing into the earth
and rooting up the young plants. Another species (and genus)
is strikingly modified for aquatic life, having webbed toes, and
a thick and powerful tail. The smallest species known is only
two inches long, with a tail of three inches. Small as the
animals of this family are, they are remarkable from the fact
that in no equally confined area are they represented by so many
peculiar types as in Madagascar. But it is still more remarkable
that the only other known genus of Centetidæ is found in
the West India Islands; two portions of the same family being
separated from each other by an extensive continent as well as
by a deep ocean.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">LEMURS</div>

<p>These sketches of the forest would be very incomplete without
saying something about what are the most characteristic
animals of Madagascar—viz. the lemurs; for though there are
a few allied forms found in Africa on the one side, and in
Southern Asia on the other, this island is <em>the</em> home of Lemuroid
animals. It was indeed proposed to call a supposed former
continent in the Indian Ocean by the name of “Lemuria.” It
must be said, however, that there are few of them to be seen in
the neighbourhood of the sanatorium, although the cries of
some may be heard, a strange long-drawn-out wailing sound, as
if of people in distress, or children crying. Yet it was always
a pleasant sound to me, as a sign of life, and probably of enjoyment,
in these active and harmless denizens of the woods.
There are no fewer than thirty-nine different species of these
animals living in Madagascar, of which twenty-nine are the true
lemurs, while the other ten are closely allied to them and are
lemur-like (Lemuroida). The eastern and north-eastern forests<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
contain about a third of the larger number; and M. Grandidier
has pointed out that while some species have a wide range,
others have a very distinctly defined habitat, which is frequently
limited by two rivers, one to the north and the other to the
south of their district.</p>

<p>Three species of the Propitheques (Lemuroida) are known by
the Malagasy under the common name of <em>Sìmpona</em>. They live
in companies of from six to eight, and are diurnal animals; one
may see them morning and evening, when the heat is not too
great, leaping in the woods from tree to tree in search of food.
Often they may be surprised at sunrise, says M. Grandidier,
squatting on the fork of a tree, their long legs bent under them,
touching the chin, their hands resting on their knees, stretching
out their arms and legs so as not to lose a single ray of the
newly risen sun. The food of these animals is entirely vegetable;
and they are formed for purely arboreal life, for there
is a membrane along the arms and legs which acts, to a certain
extent, as a parachute, so that they make leaps of from twenty-five
to thirty feet without apparent effort, and they seem to fly
through the air. On the rare occasions when they leave the
woods they advance by leaps, as if their feet were tied together,
and have a most comical appearance as they go across a bit of
open ground. One of these sìmpona is silvery-grey in colour,
with black head and neck; another is entirely white, except for
its dark brown face; and a third species is black or dark brown
in colour. Of the true lemurs, I had the good fortune once to
see a pair of the kind called red lemur (<i>Lemur varius</i>, var. <i>ruber</i>)
cross a path near the house; these were large and handsome
animals, warm reddish-brown in colour, and took astonishing
leaps in a most graceful manner; but they were out of sight
in an instant, and I can easily believe what is said by collectors,
that it is easier to shoot a flying bird than a lemur in motion.</p>

<p>In the small streams which occur at the bottom of many of
the ravines, we may often come across the curious nests of the
pensile weaver-bird (<i>Ploceus pensilis</i>), which are beautifully
and ingeniously constructed, shaped like an inverted chemical
retort, and are suspended from the extremities of the branches
of the trees and usually over running water. These nests are
about a foot or fourteen inches long, the bulb giving ample
room for the eggs or nestlings, and the tube, forming the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
entrance from below, being three to four inches in diameter.
The native name for this species, <em>Fòdifètsy</em>—<em>i.e.</em> the “Crafty
Fòdy”—recognises this skill of the bird in protecting its young.
The nests of another species are large and simply globular in
shape, and, from thirty to forty in number, may be seen hanging
from a single tree. The Madagascar bee-eater is one of the
most beautiful birds to be seen in the forest, both from its
elegance of form and its bright colouring of various shades of
green (<i>Merops superciliosus</i>). It has a very long curved beak,
and an extremely long tail, with two long feathers extending
beyond the others. Its nests are excavated about a foot deep
on a sand-bank bordering streams.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COUAS</div>

<p>Another group of birds, also conspicuous from their size and
colouring, must be noticed here—viz. the couas, a genus of
cuckoos peculiar to Madagascar, and of which twelve species are
known. They are large and handsomely coloured, and are, says
M. Grandidier, strictly local in their habitat, most of them being
confined to one district, out of which they are never found.
Five species of coua inhabit the forests or wooded regions, while
the other seven live on the plains. The blue coua (<i>Coua
cerulea</i>), the only species I have seen in the upper forest, is
fairly common, and is conspicuous from its colouring; while
the crested coua is found all over the wooded regions. One of
the twelve species goes from rock to rock, seeking the large
land-shells which form its principal food (<i>Coua delalandei</i>).
These molluscs it breaks by striking their shells against a stone,
from which habit comes its native name of <em>Famàki-sìfotra</em>, or
“snail-breaker.”</p>

<p>But several chapters would be required to say all that might
be said of interest about the birds inhabiting the upper belt of
woods, and I will not weary my readers by further descriptions,
in this place at least. I will conclude this chapter by quoting
a few sentences written about the wonder and mystery of the
Madagascar forests by my late friend, Mr Baron; for no one
knew better than he did how to explore and how to describe
them.</p>

<p>After speaking of the fatigue of travelling in the forest, Mr
Baron says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But the true lover of Nature almost loses any sense
of fatigue in the excitement and pleasure afforded by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
infinitely varied and beautiful forms of vegetable and animal
life that are around him. The tall trees of innumerable species,
in fierce competition with their neighbours, rearing their great
trunks heavenwards that they may spread out their foliage,
and open their blossoms in the light above, the fantastic foldings
and twistings of the snake-like lianas, the countless shapes and
tints of the leaves, the bright colours of some brilliant beetle, the
delicately traced wing design of some happy butterfly, the
merry chirping of some gaily adorned bird, the hurried steps
of the busy little ants, the languid movements of a chameleon,
with its strange skin and stranger eyes, the patient watching
for prey of a red three-cornered spider, the tiny mosses and
delicate ferns nestling snugly among their big brothers under the
rocks—all these and a thousand other objects of interest and
beauty help one to forget the exertion and the toil caused by
the difficulties of the road, and make one feel that it is with a
lavish and artistic hand that their great Maker has formed and
bedecked them all. Moreover, there is in travelling in the
forest a strange and fascinating illusion, a vague feeling of
expectancy, which persistently recurs, in spite of disappointment,
that somewhere on in front something of exceptional
interest will be found.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">A NIGHT IN THE FOREST</div>

<p>I have of course, during many journeys in Madagascar, spent
many a night in small villages surrounded by forest, but I have
not had quite the experiences described by Mr Baron in another
passage which I shall venture to quote. Mr Baron says:</p>

<div class="sidenote">NOCTURNAL NOISES</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To spend a night in the forest is an experience worth having.
Bivouacked in some open glade, through which a small stream
creeps lazily along, with a warm cheering fire to keep off the dew
and chill of the night, one gains a quite different knowledge of
the forest from that which one gets in the daytime, for all
nature is not asleep even in the midnight hour. Just as darkness
is setting in the fireflies with their tiny lanterns flit about
among the bushes; and the cicada, of various species, perched
on the trunks of trees, commence their strange song. They are
small in size, but certainly they make a big din. Well may the
Malagasy proverb say: ‘Don’t be like the cicada, whose voice
fills the whole valley, though the creature itself is but a mouthful.’
The sound it makes is not a buzz-z exactly, and it is not
a hum-m-m. It is a deafening, unceasing, rasping, irritating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
monotone. As the darkness increases, various nocturnal
creatures come forth from their hiding-places, and every now
and then pounce on their unconscious prey. Keep awake a
while and listen to the strange and, for the most part, mysterious
sounds. Suddenly there is a terrific scream. Some bird
or beastie finds itself all at once in the jaws of death. And
what is that ceaseless creaking throughout the night? Fancy
or fear pictures some strange hobgoblin; it is, however, nothing
but the leaves of a screw-pine twisted and strained by the
breeze. And what is that remarkable string of sounds for all
the world like water bubbling out a bottle? It is the <em>Tolòho</em>,
a kind of cuckoo, disturbed in its night’s repose. And then, at
regular intervals, ‘<em>kow-kow-koo, kow-kow-koo</em>’; what is that?
Another cuckoo, the <em>Kankàfotra</em>, which never seems to go to
sleep. From the stream or marsh close by there rises the
unmusical croak of the frogs. After an interval of silence, you
first of all hear a single croak, then another, and another, until
gradually there arises a perfect chorus, which is kept up throughout
the night. The tree-frogs also, perched on the leaves, not
a whit behind their cousins in the marsh, pass the night in
croaking. Numerous other strange and weird noises are to be
heard during the night in the forest, but from what throats they
proceed it is beyond me to say.”</p>

<span class="fs70">ROUND ANTSIHÀNAKA</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">SOME years ago I was asked to accompany two gentlemen
on a journey to one of the then least-known provinces
of Madagascar, that occupied by the Sihànaka or lake-dwellers.
Two of our party took surveying instruments with
them, and we were thus able to prepare the first accurate map
of the Antsihànaka province.</p>

<p>My companions on this journey were the late Rev. Dr
Mullens, then Foreign Secretary of the London Missionary
Society, and the late Rev. John Pillans, one of the directors
of the same society, and most pleasant and genial companions
they were. Dr Mullens was very fond of a joke and enjoyed
recalling humorous passages from Dickens or from <cite>Punch</cite>; he
was also a born geographer and had a wonderful eye for the
beautiful and the picturesque in scenery. Mr Pillans was a
graver man, but one of solid worth and good judgment; and in
the tent which we carried with us we three had many a happy
evening together. Like all journeys made in those days, this
one was performed in the <em>filanjàna</em> or light palanquin; and
not only did Dr Mullens, with an azimuth compass, take angles
and bearings for the map, but he also took a number of photographs
all along our route. I had with me a good theodolite,
so that we were able to compare and check each other’s
observations.</p>

<p>A few words may be said here about the position of the
Antsihànaka province. Repeated reference has been already
made in this book to the double belt of forest which runs for
several hundred miles along the eastern side of Madagascar. A
glance at a physical map of the island will show that, at about
the seventeenth parallel of south latitude, this double line unites
into one broader belt, becoming very wide west of Antongil
Bay. It is the open country south of the junction of the two
forests that forms the home of the Sihànaka tribe. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
valley or plain, for it is enclosed on each side by forest-covered
ranges of hills, is about thirty miles across; it is perfectly level,
and the greater portion of it is marsh; and at the north-eastern
corner of the marsh is a fine lake called Alaotra, which communicates
with the sea by the river Màningòry. It seems probable
that the people came up from the coast by the valley of this
river, and then settled on the edges of the plain, as their villages
are most numerous around the north-eastern bay of the lake;
while there is a large tract of fertile country to the south of
them which is almost entirely without inhabitants. The name
of the people is no doubt derived from the character of the
country they inhabit, for the verb <em>mihànaka</em> means to spread
out as a liquid, as ink on blotting-paper, for instance. <em>Hànaka</em>
is also used as a synonym for the words meaning lake, pool,
etc. Until about the commencement of the past century the
Sihànaka were independent of any external authority, but at
that period they were conquered by the Hova, although not
without a severe struggle. After that they quietly submitted
to the central government, and until the French conquest (1895)
their two chief towns were garrisoned by Hova officers and
soldiers, as at the time of our visit. No European missionary
had then lived in Antsihànaka, and the congregations and
schools we saw, wherever we went, were largely the result of
the work of a Hova evangelist, who lived among the people for
two or three years.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SIHÀNAKA</div>

<p>After two days’ journey over high moory country, and then
over a range of mountains called Ambòhitsitàkatra, from which
we took a number of compass bearings, we arrived on a Friday
afternoon at the village of Anjozòrobé (“At much papyrus”),
a place containing about seventy houses pretty closely packed
together within a circular fence of prickly pear and other spiny
shrubs. It was built on rising ground overlooking a level plain
to the north-west, evidently a former lake-bottom, through which
the river Mànanàra flows in a very serpentine course to join the
Bétsibòka. We crossed the river, here about thirty yards wide,
with a strong body of water, by a bridge of two massive balks of
timber supported by a rough pier of stones in the centre, and
then ascended by a very steep path to the neat chapel, which
stood in a compound a little way from the village. We took
up our quarters in this clean whitewashed building; and here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
I may remark that in former times the rude village chapels
generally formed the missionary’s “Travellers’ Bungalow.”
They were usually not encumbered with pews or seats, or,
indeed, much furniture or fittings of any kind; they were more
roomy than the native houses and generally much cleaner, at
least they had no soot hanging in festoons from the roof; so
that they formed very convenient resting-places for a missionary
traveller, and a favourable place for meeting the people and
prescribing for their ailments.</p>

<p>We had intended to proceed northwards on the following
day, but as we had to pass through the inner belt of forest and
enter on entirely unknown ground, as to which we could get no
definite information with regard to villages or congregations,
we eventually determined to stay at Anjozòrobé over the
Sunday. Saturday morning was occupied in ascending a
mountain, four or five miles distant to the north (Ambòhimiàrimbé—<em>i.e.</em>
“The High Uplifting One”), to take bearings,
etc., and the afternoon in taking photographs of the village
and river valley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN EXTENSIVE VIEW</div>

<p>On Monday morning we resumed our journey northward,
and towards midday entered the belt of forest which covers
that western line of hills of which I have already spoken.
We had been approaching it obliquely in a north-north-east
direction for the last two days. An ascent of about five
hundred feet brought us to the summit, for the road passes
along the narrow knife-edge-like ridge of the very highest
point, a hill called Ambàravàrambàto (“At the Stone
Gateway”), having two heads of almost equal height, with
a depression between them. These points, from their peculiar
outline, gave us a useful landmark to connect our journey
northwards with the ground we had already traversed. Soon
after noon we stopped for a few minutes at the top, and had
an extensive view all around us. North and south, the line
of forest-covered hills dividing Imèrina from the lower plateau
of Ankay stretched away on either hand into the far distance.
Behind us were the bare hills and downs of Imèrina, before us
the Ankay plain, many of the low hills covered, and almost
every valley filled, with bright green woods. Beyond this were
lines of hills increasing in height until they met the mountains
of Béfòrona and Anàlamazàotra, clothed with the broader of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
two belts of forest which run down the eastern side of Madagascar.
Far to the north in the dim distance we could just see the
southern portion of the Antsihànaka plain. A very steep
descent, first down an exceedingly rugged kind of stone staircase,
and then through dense wood, hardly allowing passage for the
palanquin in several places, brought us down to a charming
valley between two great spurs of the hills. After about an
hour more we came to a little village, where we were glad to get
some rest and food after six or seven hours’ hard travelling.
The aneroid informed us that we had descended more than
one thousand two hundred feet from the summit of the hill, and
about seven hundred feet from the upper plateau of Imèrina.
We had to pitch the tent in the open plain that night, for a
village of which we had heard, and had expected to be a good-sized
place, proved to be only a collection of eight or nine
miserable huts, scattered about in twos and threes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANT-HILLS</div>

<p>The following day our journey northward was over a pleasant
undulating country, but almost entirely uninhabited; here and
there were solitary houses far apart from each other, but no
villages. On the bare downs we frequently came across ant-hills,
about two feet high and formed of the greyish soil. It is
said by the people all over the island that a serpent called
<em>Rènivìtsika</em> (<em>i.e.</em> “mother of ants”) is enticed by these ants
into its nest, and is then fattened, killed and eaten by them.
The Hova in the centre of the island, the Bétsiléo in the south,
the Sàkalàva in the west, and Sihànaka in the north-east, all
affirm that this is a fact; and it seems difficult to doubt their
united testimony. After a long ride of six hours we at last
came to a group of six or seven houses called Andrànokòbaka,
where we rested for a time and had tiffin. This place appeared
to be the first of the Sihànaka villages from the south. There
was an evident difference in the appearance of the people; the
women reminded me of the Bétsimisàraka on the east coast, and
both men and women had their hair plaited in a great number
of little ropes ending in a knot, and hanging loosely all round
the head. The women and children, even those who had no
kind of clothing, all had some kind of ornament: necklaces of
red beads or silver chains, and armlets of silver, a striking contrast
to the lower class of Hovas, who only put on ornaments
on extraordinary occasions. The village smelt strongly of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
<em>tòaka</em>, the native rum, and the quantities of chopped sugar-cane,
from which the spirit is made, lying about the place, all told
of the liking of the people for strong drink.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE DRINK EVIL</div>

<p>This indeed is one of the flagrant evils common among the
Sihànaka, as it is also of many of the outlying tribes. My
friend, Mr Stribling, who lived among these people for several
years, gives the following incident illustrating the power which
rum has over them:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Calling at a village one day for shelter from a sudden
storm, we were most graciously received by a native, who
was decidedly ‘the worse’ for drink. Wishing to be sociable,
however, I said to my host, ‘Well, my friend, how many horns
of rum can you drink before becoming drunk?’ (The Sihànaka
use the horns of oxen instead of glasses, for drinking.) In
a most friendly manner the man replied, ‘Well, I can drink
three hornfuls at least’ (about one and a half quarts). ‘How
much water would you mix with it?’ ‘Water! why, we
never put water into the rum, that would make it insipid.’
Thereupon, turning to a little girl about six years old, the
man said, ‘This is my daughter, a scholar in your mission
school at Ambàndrika.’ ‘And does she also drink rum?’ ‘Of
course, why not?’ He then told me that the baby, a year
old, who was also present, was a son of his. ‘And does he
also drink rum?’ ‘O dear, no! he is still only a fool.’ ‘Then
he will drink it when he becomes wise?’ ‘Of course he will;
we all drink it when we come to understand what is good.’”</p>
</div>

<p>We encamped again in the open grassy plain, near two or
three houses and a cattle-fold; and the following morning
proceeded on our journey to the north-north-east. An hour
and a half’s ride brought us to two considerable villages near an
extensive rice-valley. Here we were surprised to see the fields
dotted over with round stacks of rice with conical heads, much
like those in an English farmyard. And we also found that
here and all through Antsihànaka the rice is not transplanted,
as in Imèrina, but after the ground has been trampled over by
oxen the seed is sown broadcast, and the rice grows there until
it is fit for cutting. After leaving these villages we began to
mount a line of hills which forms the eastern boundary of the
more level portion of the Ankay valley; and on reaching its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
summit we saw before us the vast green plain of Antsihànaka
stretching away to the northward, level as a lake, with long
lines of promontory jutting out into it from the north-west and
south-east, and a few low rounded hills rising out of it like
islands from a sea. In the far north-east the waters of the lake
Alaotra gleamed in the sunshine. To the south and east of the
plain we could see several large villages, but the chief town,
Ambàtondrazàka, was hidden from view by an intervening line
of hill. We crossed ridge after ridge and valley after valley,
hoping each would prove the last. The path over one of these
valleys, a mile and a half wide, was especially difficult; a
narrow winding track amongst swamp, prickly bamboo,
enormous papyrus and rushes, with here and there deep running
streams, whose only bridge was a slippery round pole partly
under water; so that we afterwards spoke of it as “the great
dismal swamp!” But we met with others equally bad, if not
worse, on our subsequent journeys round the plain, and the
passage seemed not nearly so formidable on our return.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GRASSES</div>

<p>I was struck here, as well as in many other parts of the district,
by the remarkable and varied fragrance of the wild plants
growing among the grass. The scents appeared to me as
equally a convincing proof as the sights and sounds that one
was really in a tropical country. And here, as we have been
travelling for several days over country that is chiefly bare
moor (except the narrow belt of forest at the “Stone Gateway”),
I may appropriately say something about the grasses of Madagascar,
which must attract the attention of every observant
traveller. They are of great variety and beauty, and prominent
among them are different species of <em>Véro</em>. Of these the one
called simply <em>Véro</em> rises to a height of eight or ten feet, and has
a head of flowers somewhat like oats, but much longer. This
tall grass presents a varied appearance at different stages of its
growth. When in full flower, the heads contain a large number
of oat-like seeds with long awns, but later on the seeds fall off,
and at the head of each little branchlet there appears a minute
tuft of feathery plumes, like little stars, giving the grass quite
a different aspect from its first one. Another species, called
<em>Vérontsànjy</em>, has a still more beautiful floral crown, and is as tall
as the first-named one, but not so common. These two grasses,
when seen in a mass, give a warm brown tint to the spots where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
they grow. In some parts, however, a much shorter grass, of
a pale buff colour, is the prevailing growth. In other places,
another very tall grass called <em>Famòa</em> flourishes; this is a light
graceful grass, with fine branchlets from its head, and the seeds
showing prominently; and the whole is of a delicate pea-green
colour. Then there are other grasses, which are richly marked
with shades of dark red or purple, displaying masses of these
tints when seen from a little distance. The shorter grasses are
not less beautiful than the taller species just mentioned; but
without coloured drawings it is impossible to give any adequate
idea of their charm and variety.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEIR HEIGHT</div>

<p>There is one thing especially which strikes a European newly
come into the country with regard to the Madagascar grasses,
and that is, the height to which they grow, if left undisturbed.
In sheltered valleys and other places not reached by the fires
which sweep over the downs in the dry season, the grass grows
considerably above one’s head, so that I have felt how soon one
might be lost in certain conditions. After the year of rebellion
against French rule in 1896, I found the véro and other grasses
grown as high as I was when sitting in my palanquin—about
eight feet above the ground. For several months large tracts
of country had been desolate and left uncultivated, and were returning
to a state of nature. And in many places, at every few
yards, we disturbed coveys of partridges or quails or other wild
birds, which had greatly multiplied in the depopulated country.</p>

<p>Soon after four o’clock we mounted the last low ridge, and
Ambàtondrazàka lay before us, about a mile and a half distant.
The town, which consisted of about four hundred houses, is
situated on a low peninsula projecting from the hills on the
southern side of the plain. It had a pleasant, civilised appearance
after the wretched huts we had seen for the last two or
three days. A broad road running down from the hill seemed
to divide the town into two pretty nearly equal parts. West
of this road a large substantial chapel showed out conspicuously,
and on the opposite side was the square palisaded enclosure
called the <em>ròva</em>, filled with the houses of the Hova officers
and soldiers who formed the garrison of the place. At the
north-east corner of the enclosure the <em>làpa</em>, or government house,
a two-storeyed building surrounded by verandahs, stood out
prominent above the rows of smaller houses. We soon established<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
ourselves inside the chapel, which was well built of clay
walls with brick gables, ninety feet long by thirty-six broad,
with good doors and windows, all well finished. The walls were
smoothly plastered and whitened, and the floor was covered with
fine mats, all sewn together.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A VISIT TO THE GOVERNOR</div>

<p>Sending in our letters of introduction to the Governor, we
were in a few minutes invited to go over and see him. Passing
through the double lines of palisading and the rows of Hova
houses, we came to the <em>làpa</em>, inside an inner enclosure of its own.
Entering the large room on the ground floor, we found the
Governor waiting to receive us. His chief officers and the civil
authorities were seated round two sides of the room, and a
number of the lower class squatted on the floor on the third side,
while on the fourth side three chairs were placed for us. As
soon as we were seated, the Governor, a tall elderly man,
receiving us most cordially, addressed us with a formal speech,
after the custom of the Malagasy officials to anyone who came
from the capital; and as this may serve as an example of the
way in which we were received in all the principal places, I will
give it pretty fully; it was in the following form:—“Since you,
gentlemen, have come from the capital, we ask of you, How is
Queen Rànavàlona, sovereign of the land? How is Rainibaiàrivòny,
Prime Minister, protector of the kingdom? How
is our father, Rainingòry (the oldest officer in the army, nearly
a hundred years old)? How is Rainimàharàvo, Chief Secretary
of State, chief of the officers of the palace? How is Rabé
(son of the preceding)? How is the kingdom of Ambòhimànga
and Antanànarìvo (the ancient and modern capitals)? How
are ‘the-under-the-heaven’ (the people, the subjects)? How
are you, our friends? And how is your fatigue after your
journey?” etc. To these inquiries I, as interpreter to the
expedition, gravely replied <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">seriatim</i>, saying that her Majesty
was well, that the Prime Minister was well, etc., etc., and then
inquired how the Governor and his officers, and the people of the
town and neighbourhood were. We then had more general and
less formal conversation, in which I explained the objects of our
visit to Antsihànaka, and our proposed route round the district.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="p1801_ill" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p1801_ill.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Wayside Market</span><br />

The umbrellas are to protect the vendors and goods from the sun. Beef, soap, candles, cooked rice, manioc, etc.,
are exposed for sale</div>
</div>

<p>The Governor then courteously led us by the hand back to
the chapel, where he joined us in our dinner; and as soon as
that was finished asked us to come outside. Here we found a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
quantity of provisions brought for us and our bearers; baskets
of rice, geese, fowls, yams, and a large fat pig (a most unwilling
offering <em>he</em> was, and loudly protested against the whole business).
In a formal speech, as soon as silence could be obtained, the
Governor offered these things to us, saying that the provisions
presented were not theirs, but the Queen’s, the Prime Minister’s,
etc., etc., while <em>they</em> only took charge of it all (a polite and loyal
fiction, by the way, meaning nothing). We found a comfortable
(if somewhat airy) bedroom in the spacious chapel, which
formed a pleasant contrast to the confinement of our little tent
of eleven feet square.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARKET DAY</div>

<p>The next day, Thursday, was market day, and a number of
people from the country were collected together buying and
selling on an open piece of rising ground to the south of the
town. The morning we devoted to inspecting the place,
ascertaining the number of houses, and taking bearings, observations
and photographs from a point half-a-mile to the east of
the market. Our proceedings caused intense interest, as the
camera, theodolite, etc., were carried past; business came to a
standstill for some time, and a glance at the crowd through the
field-glass showed rows of dark faces all turned in our direction,
intently watching our mysterious proceedings. We afterwards
walked through the market, hoping to find some articles of
food or manufacture new to us; but there was not much that
differed from what may be seen every day in Imèrina. In fruit
I fancied I had found something new—viz. what appeared like
a kind of small banana with black skin; but more minute
inspection showed that the supposed fruits were small fish from
the lake, smoke-dried, strung on a strong reed. Some large
wooden spoons with tin ornaments on the handles reminded me
of those made by the Bétsiléo. Bananas, very large and fine,
seemed the most plentiful fruit; sugar-cane grows to a great
size, ten to twelve feet high; and from what we saw all round
Antsihànaka it appeared a most fertile district, with rich
alluvial soil; were the whole marsh drained and brought under
cultivation, as the marshy plain to the west and north-west of
the capital has been, it would support a population many times
greater than that which inhabits Imèrina. All round Ambàtondrazàka
many hundred acres of the level are occupied by
rice-fields, and it is the same in the neighbourhood of all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
villages bordering the plain; although a large proportion of the
area is still covered with marsh, reeds, rushes and papyrus.
From the rising ground we could count numerous herds of fine
cattle, generally from seventy to eighty in each herd, and
wherever we went we found cattle in great abundance feeding
on the rich pasture. Large numbers of these cattle belonged
to rich people in Imèrina. One noble was said to have nearly
ten thousand; others had five thousand; many people had
a thousand, and the majority of the Sihànaka had at least a
hundred each.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PAPYRUS</div>

<p>After our usual employments of school examination, conversation
with the pastor and others, and renewed presents of food,
on Friday morning we set off on our circuit round the plain to
visit as many of the congregations, and see as much of the
country and the position of the Sihànaka villages, as was possible
in six days, as our time was limited to that period. Proceeding
first westward, and skirting the edge of the level ground, we
passed for some distance through swamp, with dense thickets
of <em>hèrana</em> and <em>zozòro</em>, the first being, as already seen in Imèrina,
a strong sedge extensively used for roofing, and the other, a
species of papyrus, employed for a variety of purposes. This
latter grows here to a great size, some ten or twelve feet high,
with a triangular and exceedingly tough stem, about two and
a half inches each way, nearly double the size it attains in the
cooler Imèrina province.</p>

<p>We had to cross numerous little streams by rickety bridges
of plank. From the level of the rice-fields the plain stretched
northward like an immense green lake; the rotundity of the
earth was as clearly seen from the perfect level as it is from the
surface of the sea, for the distant low hills appeared like detached
islands with nothing to connect their bases. Our course
lay west by north-west, cutting diagonally across several of
those promontories formed by the parallel lines of hills which
run down each side of the Ankay valley. Every village of the
Sihànaka has near its entrance a group of two or three tall
straight trunks of trees fixed in the ground, varying from
thirty to fifty feet in height; the top of these has the appearance
of an enormous pair of horns, for the fork of a tree is fixed
to the pole, and each branch is sharpened to a fine point.
Besides these, there are generally half-a-dozen lower poles, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
which are fixed a number of the skulls and horns of bullocks
killed at the funeral of the people of whom these poles are the
memorial. One thing struck us as curious: several of the
higher poles had small tin trunks, generally painted oak colour,
impaled on one point of the fork; and in several instances
baskets and mats were also placed on a railing of wood close to
the poles supporting the bullock horns. These various articles
were the property of the deceased, and put near his grave with
the hope of their being of some benefit to his spirit; or perhaps
from the idea, common to most of the Malagasy tribes, of there
being pollution attached to anything connected with the dead.
In several cases, on the very highest point of the lofty poles,
there was a small tin fixed, having a strong resemblance to
those we import containing jam or preserved provisions.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> As
among many Eastern peoples, so in Madagascar, the horn is a
symbol of power and protection; the native army was termed
<em>tàndroky ny fanjakàna</em>—“horns of the kingdom.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">CATTLE</div>

<p>Some of the cattle we saw were magnificent animals, and it is
not strange that the bull was used frequently in public speeches,
as an emblem of strength, as it is the largest of all the animals
known to the Malagasy. It frequently occurs in this sense in
the formulæ and the songs connected with the circumcision
ceremonial; for the observance of this native custom was a
time of very great importance in the old native regime. Bull-fighting
was a favourite amusement with the Malagasy sovereigns;
and in digging the foundations for a new gateway to the
palace yard at Antanànarìvo, the remains of a bull were discovered,
wrapped up in a red silk <em>làmba</em>, the same style of
burial as that employed for rich people. This was the honour
paid to a famous fighting bull belonging to Queen Rànavàlona I.
It seems pretty certain that anciently the killing of an ox was
regarded as a semi-religious or sacrificial observance, and only
the chief of a tribe was allowed to do this, as priest of his
people. Robert Drury, an English lad who, with others, was
wrecked on the south-west coast of Madagascar in 1702, and
remained in the country as a slave for fifteen years, gives many
particulars about this custom of the southern Sàkalàva people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE OX</div>

<p>An old Malagasy saying thus describes the various uses of the
different portions of an ox when killed: “The ox is the chief
of the animals kept by the people, and they are very beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
in this country. Our forefathers here knew well how it should
be used, and they said thus, when they invoked a blessing (at
the circumcision): The ox’s horns go to the spoon-maker; its
molar teeth to the mat-maker (for smoothing out the <em>zozòro</em>
peel); its ears are for making medicine for nettle-rash; its
hump for making ointment; its rump to the sovereign; its
feet to the oil-maker; its spleen to the old man; its liver to the
old woman; its lungs to the son-in-law; its intestines to those
who brought the ropes; its neck to him who brought the axe;
its haunch to the crier; its tail to the weaver; its suet to the
soap-maker; its skin to the drummer; its head to the speech-maker;
its eyes to be made into beads (used in the divination),
and its hoofs to the gun-maker.”</p>

<p>Our next morning’s ride brought us to Ambòhidèhilàhy, a
large village of a hundred and twenty or a hundred and thirty
houses, occupying the northern end of one of the promontories.</p>

<p>For the first time since we had left Ambòhimànga we had a
meal in an ordinary house, and could notice the arrangement
of a Sihànaka dwelling. I immediately observed that instead
of there being <em>one</em> post at each end and at the centre of the
house to support the ridge, as in the Imèrina houses, this had
<em>three</em> at each gable, just as the Bétsimisàraka have; another
confirmation, by the way, of my belief, that the Sihànaka are
connected with the coast tribes, and have come up from the sea
and settled on the margin of the fertile plain. Instead of the
one door and window on the west side, as in the Hova houses,
the Sihànaka make two doors on that side, with high thresholds,
dividing it into three equal parts, and a low door on the
eastern side, coming where the fixed bedstead is placed in
Imèrina. Here the bedstead was at the south-east instead of
the north-east corner; and the hearth, with its framework
above for supporting property of various kinds, at the south-east
instead of the mid-west side of the house.</p>

<p>After dinner we set off over level ground for Manàkambahìny,
a village nearly south from us, which we could see on a low hill
forming the extremity of the high ridge bounding the Mangòro
valley to the west. We found that the small rivers between the
parallel ranges of hills spread out into many shallow streams
over a wide surface, forming a swamp with luxuriant rushes and
vegetation. The wild birds seemed plentiful here. In several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
places was a kind of snare for taking them on the wing, consisting
of several stout bamboos fixed in the ground a few feet apart,
with cords stretched between them, and loops of string suspended
from these cords. We were only able to stay a short
time at the village, and then pushed on, crossing the level
ground at the southern extremity of the Antsihànaka plain and
coming at sunset to Ambòdinònoka, a good-sized village on
its western edge. Here we had reached our farthest south in
our journey round the province.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIHÀNAKA MATS</div>

<p>We have just seen the interior of a Sihànaka house, and
we ought to have noticed the fine and strong mats with which
they are furnished. From the immense extent of marsh, the
material for making these is very abundant, and all women can
make them; so no Sihànaka <em>buys</em> a mat, for they think that a
disgrace. Of the <em>zozòro</em> outer peel, or skin, the very long mats
called the Queen’s are made, which are from eighteen feet to
twenty-four feet long. The houses of many people here are
clean and neat from the abundance of such mats. The largest
kind of <em>zozòro</em>, called <em>tèry</em>, is as strong as wood, and the firm
triangular stems are used for the walls of the houses.</p>

<p>We were off early on Saturday morning, for, as we wished to
get to the second town in size, Ampàrafàravòla, for Sunday, we
had a long day’s journey northward of nine or ten hours before
us. We were now skirting the western edge of the great level,
now and then crossing patches of swamp, and then following
the windings of a small river, which we had at last to cross by
canoes. The whole country appeared to abound with wild
birds of different kinds—herons, black and white storks, wild
geese, wild ducks, partridges and many others. The fen
country of the eastern midland counties of England, before the
great drainage works were carried out and the waters led off to
the sea, must have been very much like this Antsihànaka plain,
which is certainly a paradise for sportsmen. There are said to
be no fewer than thirty-four species of aquatic birds found on
the Alaotra lake and in the surrounding marshy country. In
the little museum at the L.M.S. College at Antanànarìvo we
have, among other Malagasy birds’ eggs, a number from
Antsihànaka, chiefly of water-fowl; most of these are white,
showing probably that they are well protected and so have no
need of imitative colouring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">WATER-BIRDS</div>

<p>Of these numerous ducks and geese, perhaps the whistling
teal is the most common, not only in this province, but also in
other marshy regions. In the western part of Imèrina the
<em>Tsirìry</em>, as it is called, may be seen in flocks of five hundred
together, so that a certain district probably gets its name of
“Bé (many) tsiriry” from their numbers. At evening this
bird and a tree duck (<em>Tahìa</em>) settle down in such numbers
along the shore of the lake that one cannot walk by the waterside,
for the ground is black with them. The tsiriry builds its
nest on hillocks among the grass, and the young birds are
taken to the water as soon as hatched. Another bird, the
humped duck (<em>Aròsy</em>), lays its eggs in the crevices of rocks.
Many of the native names of these wild fowl are imitative of
their screaming cry; others are descriptive, as “white-wings,”
“handsome-bird,” “white-eyes,” “many-shields,” etc. Besides
the above-mentioned birds, there are also coots, water-hens,
herons, ibises, grebes, snipes and curlews in the lake and the
marshes. Of the white-backed duck (<em>Tafiòtra</em>) the natives
say that the female bird experiences some difficulty in the
laying of her eggs, which are very large in proportion to the
size of her body; this is said to make her faint and become
unconscious, so that she may be taken off her nest with the
hand. On account this of peculiarity, the duck is <em>fàdy</em>, or
tabooed, by the native women, who think that they would
experience a similar difficulty in child-birth were they to eat
the bird.</p>

<p>From the abundance of water-birds in this province, the
keeping of ducks and geese is an important occupation of the
Sihànaka. Geese are greatly esteemed, and alive or killed
are always presented as a mark of respect to strangers. On
account of their abundance, goose quills for pens, as well as
chillies and fine long mats, formed the tribute formerly paid by
the people to the queen at Antanànarìvo. Guinea-fowls are also
plentiful and are found in flocks of from twenty to thirty
together, but chiefly in unfrequented places.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AMBÒHITRÒMBY</div>

<p>After about two hours and a half’s journey we arrived at
Ambòhitròmby, a large village of nearly a hundred houses,
situated on a rounded hill which rose like an island from the
plain. We were formally received by an old man in a red
<em>làmba</em>, the chief of the village, in the presence of a large number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
of people, and the accustomed speech-making had to be gone
through. We then went into the chapel, a long, narrow and
low rush building, where the scholars and most of the women
were assembled. On going out of the chapel we were asked to
meet the chief people again to receive beef, rice, etc. This was
done with a formality and respect exceeding that shown on any
previous occasion. A mat was spread on an open space, on this
three chairs were placed for us, and in front of this, on another
mat, were arranged the provisions. Speech-making, compliments
and replies then followed as usual.</p>

<p>After tiffin, and taking some compass observations, we left
Ambòhitròmby soon after twelve o’clock, keeping still along
the western shore of the plain, and several times crossing bays
which run westward between the hills. Here we had much
floundering about in the bog, and crossing of cranky wooden
bridges of the primitive single round-pole construction. We
passed Mòraràno and Moraféno, good-sized villages, but were
unable to stop at either place, as they were both a little way out
of the direct road, and we were pressed for time. The population
appeared considerable about this part of the plain, for there
were many other villages at no great distance, and a very large
extent of its margin was cultivated, the stacks of rice dotting
over the level surface for two or three miles to the eastward,
and for a long way north and south. After three or four hours’
walking and riding we turned to the north-east, crossing a great
bay formed by one of the long promontories which stretch into
the level from the north-west as well as from the south-east
shores of the plain. These have evidently in an earlier
(geological) period formed continuous lines of hills, for they do
not run in the same direction as the main valley or depression
of the country, but cut it at an angle of about forty-five degrees—that
is to say, while the general direction of the Antsihànaka
valley is north-north-east and south-south-west, the lines of hills
on either side have a bearing of north-north-west and south-south-east.
This is seen very distinctly in the map of the
district made on my return home: for many of the ridges seem
to be broken off more or less abruptly by the level ground, and
then to be continued on the other side of the plain. It seemed
impossible to avoid the conclusion that by some great convulsion
in long-past geologic ages a vast rent and depression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
had been made across the lines of hills in a diagonal direction;
while the water-worn and wasted remains of some few of
these towards the south, forming a line of low detached hills,
suggested that probably the action of water, either as an arm
of the sea running up the Ankay valley, or a great river, had
completed what was commenced by more violent agencies.
The unmistakable evidence of former volcanic action, in the
presence of extinct craters and lava streams to the west,
north and north-east of the plain, seems to show what was
the agency which caused this great depression of the surface.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A NATURAL EMBANKMENT</div>

<p>Half-an-hour brought us to the end of the promontory, which
was like an enormous dyke or sea-wall, one face having a steep
slope, and the other a long gentle rise. It was a pleasant and
smooth level road along the top of this great natural embankment
to the north-west. From it we had a delightful view, for
the great flat surface of the plain looked like an immense green
lake, from which the distant eastern line of hills seemed to rise
like shores out of a green expanse of water. The high mountains
beyond these were lit up by afternoon sunlight, and the western
side or a still larger and higher promontory to the east of us,
broken up by lateral buttresses, produced charming effects of
light and shadow, and variety of colour. At the head of the
bay formed by these two long points we could see the high
rounded hill which rises above Ampàrafàravòla, and after a
time the little town itself began to show above the plain.</p>

<p>At a little before five o’clock we came to a hollow at the end
of the promontory, with a long piece of water dividing it from
a steep abrupt hill, on which the large village of Ambòhipèno
is situated. This place had a clay wall surrounding it, and
contained about ninety houses. The “road” to it is the water
just mentioned, about four feet wide, where the papyrus had
been cut away; this being past, the path was up a steep clay
slope. As we got near the village, we could see a number of
people assembled to meet us, and on arriving at the top had a
most pleasing reception. As we cleared the water and began to
ascend, the singers struck up a hymn; they were all seated on
one side of the road, the school-children on the other, while a
little farther on were a crowd of people headed by the elderly
men of the place. One of these, the judge of the district, a
pleasant old man, then received us with the usual speeches, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
which I had of course to reply. After a few minutes’ delay, and
promising to come and preach to them on the following afternoon,
we pushed on, for it was near sunset, and we had still
three or four miles to traverse before reaching our destination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A HOSPITABLE RECEPTION</div>

<p>It was about an hour after sundown before we reached Ampàrafàravòla,
but a bright moon near the full prevented any difficulty
in travelling. The town itself was almost entirely Hova,
and consisted of about ninety houses in a square stockade of
palisading, a double line of which ran all around it; but there
were as many more Sihànaka houses within half-a-mile of the
<em>ròva</em>, and two or three small villages at no great distance. On
the west side of the town was a large, well-built, clay chapel,
not then finished. Our first look at it, without any doors or
windows, made us doubtful whether we could use it as a lodging,
especially as the evening breeze blew sharply through the
numerous openings; however, as we found there were temporary
doors and shutters of <em>zozòro</em>, which filled them up to some
extent, we decided that we had better stay in it. A few
minutes after our arrival, the lieutenant-governor of the district
and his attendants came out of the <em>ròva</em> to meet us; and then,
of course, came loyal inquiries and polite speeches and, after
a little time, beef, rice and poultry, etc. We were glad at last
to get some tea, but we found the chapel very windy and letting
in far too many mosquitoes to be pleasant, so we pitched the
tent at the far end of the building as a sleeping apartment, and
by dexterous management Mr Pillans and I stole a march on
our bloodthirsty little tormentors, and managed to get a good
night’s rest; while the doctor secured the same under the protection
of his mosquito net.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning the people assembled early (rather too
early for us) outside the chapel; and as soon as we had breakfasted,
stowed away our packages, beds, etc., at the farther end,
and covered them over with our tent to make things tidy, we
let the people in. Mr Pillans’ gorgeous rug again did duty as
covering for the rough little table which served as a reading-desk,
while the doctor’s photographic chemical box made it a convenient
height. The chapel was soon well filled with people,
about four hundred and fifty in number; they came in following
the governor and his officers, who took their seats first.
Then came the commander’s wife, a very stout, pleasant-looking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
lady, who, with two or three others, were dressed in European
style, as also were the chief men of the congregation. The
ladies, however, did not patronise chairs, but had cushions laid
on the floor. About half the congregation seemed to be
Sihànaka, the rest were Hovas. As soon as service was over,
the singers begged that I would teach them a new tune; so, as
at other places, the large paper copy of one, which was then
new and very popular at the capital, was brought out, and we
practised it until we had to ask them to let our lunch be got
ready. They then removed into the schoolhouse and sang
away until it was almost time for the afternoon service; and
then again in the evening until late at night. They also learned
another new tune and hymn; and not only on Sunday night,
but early next morning, they were still at these two tunes, and
the last thing heard as we left the place was, “There is a happy
land,” etc., over and over again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANNOYING AND PAINFUL GRASS</div>

<p>In the afternoon Mr Pillans and I set off to preach to the
people at Ambòhipèno, who had received us so pleasantly on
the preceding evening. We wanted to give our own men a
perfect rest, and so got some Sihànaka bearers. They jolted
us not a little; carrying logs of timber was much more in their
line than carrying English missionaries. However, we got there
quickly and found the little chapel filled with people waiting
for us. On our way to and fro we noticed a peculiar appearance
in the grass, as if small handfuls of it were tied together in a
bundle, while still growing. On examining a tuft of this, we
found the unusual appearance was caused by a small mass of
fibres growing around, and the long awns intertwining, involving
the neighbouring grasses in their clasp; the end of each is
armed with a sharp and barbed point, fine and strong enough
to pierce the skin. This grass (<i>Andropogon contortus</i>) the
natives call <em>Léfon-dàmbo</em> (“wild-hog’s spear”). In walking
among this grass the awns cling to one’s trousers by hundreds,
and gradually make their way through to the skin, causing a
pricking like so many pins. Almost as annoying, although
not so painful, is a plant called <em>Anantsinàhy</em>, which is found all
over the central province, and of which the small dry seeds,
called <em>Tsipòlotra</em>, are furnished with fine prickles, which make
the seeds stick to your clothes by scores, as you pass through
any piece of waste ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A DINNER WITH THE GOVERNOR</div>

<p>On getting back to Ampàrafàravòla, we found that the
Governor wished us to dine with him and his officers in a small
house which then served <ins class="corr" id="tn-191" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'as the lòpa'">
as the <em>làpa</em></ins>. In the courtyard was a
little shed, much out of repair, in which was a small cannon
mounted on a very large carriage, one of those made by
M. Laborde for the old queen. At some of the places we subsequently
visited, after the usual loyal inquiries for the queen,
great officers, and for the governor and lieutenant-governor of the
Sihànaka, inquiry was also made as to the welfare of this little
two-pounder gun! We <em>might</em> have replied, but did not, that a
cleaning now and then, and a little more thatch on the roof
of its shed, would probably tend to prolong its existence and
conduce to its general well-being. Our dinner was served in
thoroughly native style, being cooked in the same place where
we ate it, and with about a score of people helping to serve us
guests, three in number. They gave us rice and some excellently
cooked beef and turkey, and milk to drink. The chief
cook would not allow us to make any permanent impression on
the heaped-up piles of rice on our plates, for every few minutes
they were replenished by fresh supplies of rice and gravy, so we
were obliged at last to relinquish the unequal contest. Before
dinner they came to ask us if the band should play during the
entertainment (as is customary when the great people in Imèrina
give feasts); but as I felt doubtful as to the character of the
tunes that the bandmaster might have available for the occasion,
I said that, being Sunday, it might be well to omit the
compliment; but I very readily agreed to their suggestion that
the singers should sing a hymn tune instead, which they did
outside the house. After doing justice to the fare, we returned
to our chapel lodgings, greatly pleased with much we had seen
during the day.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> Subsequently, my friends, the late Rev. J. Pearse and his

work until 1895. For some years past Christian teaching has
been carried on by Malagasy sent by the native missionary

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> It may be remarked here how ubiquitous are the disused

are packed. We were amused during our tour by the evidence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
of this in different parts of Antsihànaka. It is usual in the
Malagasy congregations for a small tin box to be fixed near the
door of the church to receive money contributions and “the
weekly offering.” We found that in some villages old jam tins
were employed for this purpose; in others again sardine boxes
were the favourite receptacle for the gifts of the congregation;
while in yet other districts a military feeling was apparently
the prominent one, for old powder flasks were suspended from
the wall for the Sunday contributions.</p>

<span class="fs70">LAKE SCENERY</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">WE were up early on Monday morning, the doctor to
prepare paper for photographs, Mr Pillans and I to
survey. He and I walked up a rounded scarped hill,
about a mile to the north-east of the town. This was the only
place we had seen in the neighbourhood which showed this rude
kind of fortress, so common on the hills of Imèrina and the
Bétsiléo country. It was a dull cloudy morning, and we could not
get any distant points, but took the bearings of a few neighbouring
villages. But we were greatly interested to find that the hill
had certainly been the centre of volcanic action, was, in fact, an
extinct crater, for large masses of lava were scattered all over
the hill, from the base to the summit. We afterwards found, as
we proceeded on our journey round its north-western slopes,
that the crater was on that side, and that from it a stream of
molten rock had poured down, spreading over a considerable
surface of ground. After bidding our good friends farewell,
although they much wished to keep us longer, we left at nine
o’clock, still going northward. We crossed over the head of
the large bay of the plain formed by the long promontory,
passed a little cluster of villages called Mòraràno, and then
ascended the ridge of hills, coming out on some very high
ground which forms the western boundary or shore of this part
of the plain. From it we had an extensive view over the great
level surface, and could see the whole length of the Alaotra
lake from north to south. There was a fine variety of outline
in the eastern line of hills and mountains, and towards the
north end of the plain there was a great opening between the
hills, showing the valley through which the Màningòry river
runs from the lake to the sea. We soon left the high ground
and came down to the plain, skirting its edge, generally on low
hills, and occasionally crossing great arms of it running westward.
Several of these were very boggy and difficult to cross,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
with the most complicated and impracticable bridges we had
yet seen, even in Antsihànaka; some of them were in three
stages, one a steepish ascent, the middle span on the level, and
another going down again into <em>water</em>, not on to dry land, and
none boasting more than a slippery round pole as roadway.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CURIOUS CUSTOM</div>

<p>Our journey of six hours and three-quarters to-day was only
broken by half-an-hour’s halt on a low hill to take observations;
indeed there was no village, nor even a house, where we could
have stayed, for we were travelling over a perfectly uninhabited
country. After we left Mòraràno, about an hour north of
Ampàrafàravòla, we saw not a single human habitation nor
trace of cultivation, although there were numerous fertile and
spacious valleys, until we arrived at Ambòhijànahàry. The
only object we saw that gave any sign of man’s presence was a
large herd of fine cattle. I was afterwards told of a curious
custom formerly practised by the Sihànaka at the time of the
circumcision. They used to choose one of the largest oxen to
be found and sharpened his horns to a fine point; after two or
three days’ continuous drinking, when they had got perfectly
maddened with spirits and were ready for any foolhardy
adventure, a party would rush out to attack this ox, but without
any weapons. As the animal became infuriated, he of course
defended himself by goring his enemies, many of whom he generally
seriously hurt, and some occasionally killed outright, while
the man who escaped without injury was considered as born
under a lucky star, and was resorted to by numbers of people
to give them charms to protect them from various kinds of
calamity.</p>

<p>Soon after four o’clock we reached Ambòhijànahàry, a large
village of about a hundred houses, on rising ground, and
approached by a long narrow passage between dense thickets
of prickly pear. It is a poor dirty place, and the chapel the
smallest one we had yet seen in the district, being only twenty-two
feet by sixteen wide. However, it was clean and neatly
matted, and after stopping up a door and a window on the
windward side we put up the tent as a canopy for sleeping
under, as the gables were exceedingly well ventilated. Then
came speeches, beef, etc., etc., and replies as usual, <em>my</em> oratorical
efforts becoming very brief; my companions remarked that
the flowery parts of my speeches in reply were gradually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
curtailed as we proceeded farther on our journey. To the
north of the village is a lofty point, called Ankìtsika; it has a
double cone-shaped outline—that is, a small cone upon a large
truncated one—and is doubtless of volcanic origin. The word
Ankìtsika means “at a cave,” and there is said to be a
cave at the top, where, in former times, the people took
refuge when their enemies, the Sàkalàva, made a raid upon
them.</p>

<p>The village which we had now come to was “our farthest
north,” for from here we began to turn our faces homewards;
and as we had now seen the largest villages in the province, I
may as well say something here about the Sihànaka, and their
occupations and means of subsistence.</p>

<p>Their occupations are, chiefly, tending cattle, growing rice,
fishing, and making <em>tòaka</em> (rum). Almost every family keeps
cattle, save the very poorest, and there is nothing the people
like better than to follow their herds and camp out in the
pastures with their wives and children. The day of cutting
the ears of the young animals (so as to distinguish them from
those of the queen) was always kept as a day of rejoicing,
killing oxen, and feasting. Yet very few milk their cattle, for
they prefer the broth made from fish to milk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STORING RICE</div>

<p>As we went round the outside edge of the plain, we saw a large
extent of rice ground under cultivation; but the people do not
dig the soil, or transplant the rice, as is the custom in Imèrina,
but cultivate their fields in the following way. First of all they
make a number of low earthen banks, which are intended to
hold the water. That being done, oxen are driven over the
ground to be planted, where the water is a few inches deep, and
when the soil has been well turned over, then the rice is sown;
and there it is left until it is reaped, without transplanting or
weeding. When the rice has been reaped, it is heaped together
in round stacks, which are of a considerable size. When quite
dry, the grain is threshed out with a stick, two men or more
striking in regular turn. The rice is not stored in pits, as in
Imèrina, but in an enormous kind of basket or round enclosure,
made of papyrus plaited together, and about eight feet high
and from twenty to thirty feet in diameter. These are in the
fields, and are roofed over; and rice being so cheap and plentiful
with them, the people do not measure the rice itself, but they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
reckon it by the number of these <em>vòlovàry</em>, of which the richer
Sihànaka have seven or eight or more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CATCHING FISH</div>

<p>Catching fish in the lake and in the numerous streams and
pieces of water is the business of both men and women. The
men angle for eels, the women dredge for small fish in the
shallow water (using a kind of basket like a large sieve), and
the little children fish with bait. All the children have a tiny
canoe, in which they go fishing in the early morning from six
to nine o’clock, when they return home, for their small canoes
would be upset by the wind and waves as the day advances.
The women catch, by dredging, small fish called <em>tòho</em> and also
shrimps. These they dry in the sun, sew up in baskets, and take
for sale to the markets, many people becoming wealthy by their
sale. Until a few years ago all sales were done by barter, for
little money was employed. And it is the custom for the men
not to bring home what they have caught, but to leave it by
the waterside for the women to fetch.</p>

<p>There is abundance of <em>tòaka</em> (rum) made in Antsihànaka, and
its manufacture is the work of poor old men and women and
(formerly) of slaves. In every house it is to be found, for they
think it shows a want of respect to visitors if they have not
plenty of <em>tòaka</em> to give them. Whatever be the business in
hand, whether funerals or rejoicings, nothing can be done without
drinking <em>tòaka</em> (see an earlier paragraph).</p>

<p>We left Ambòhijànahàry on Tuesday morning and turned
eastward. Our road lay through low swampy ground, often
wading through water and floundering through bog. But there
was also a large extent of land covered with rice-fields, and we
passed several villages. We left the lines of hills, which come
down and terminate abruptly at the edge of the plain. Rain
fell during the last half of the journey and a thick mist shut
out everything from view; there was water above and around,
and water and bog below, so it was the most uncomfortable of
all our journeys. The only objects to interest were the clouds
of birds, which flew over our heads in immense numbers in
every direction. Soon after ten o’clock we got to a village of
seventy or eighty houses, called very inappropriately, Ambòhitsàra
(“good town”), for it was quite in the swamp,
raised only a few inches above the level, and surrounded by
water, most of it stagnant. Here the people of the village, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
their speech to us, spoke of our staying there that night, and
crossing the lake the following morning; but as it was still
early in the day, and the water was not an hour distant, we felt
most unwilling to stop, especially as we feared risk of fever by
staying the night in such a low and damp situation. We therefore
told them that we must, if possible, get across the lake that
day, and requested them to lose no time in getting sufficient
canoes to take us over. After tiffin, we determined to go and
see for ourselves, and with much difficulty got our men off.
The path was better than in the morning, a large extent of
land here being fine pasture and covered with cattle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A PLEASANT PICTURE</div>

<p>Three-quarters of an hour brought us to the lake, a beautiful
expanse of water, but only one small canoe was visible, and a
stiff breeze from the east had raised waves of a size quite
formidable to such cranky craft as Malagasy canoes are. The
shore opposite to us seemed from three to four miles distant;
to the northward the water extended for several miles, with
bays running up among the hills, and a large arm turning eastward
in the direction of the valley through which the river
draining the lake flows into the sea. Many of the villages on
the rising ground across the water were seen quite distinctly (for
it had turned out a lovely afternoon) and seemed large places.
A considerable portion of the population is indeed massed
round this north-east corner of the lake, and we regretted being
obliged to leave so many large villages unvisited, but our time
would not allow us to go round the head of the Alaotra. The
picture was a pleasant one from the shore; the expanse of blue
water, with the waves dancing and sparkling in the sunlight;
the villages on the green hills across the lake; and behind them
grand masses of mountain, with a good deal of dark forest
capping them. To the north of the Màningòry valley was
distinctly visible an extinct volcanic crater, with a large portion
of one of its sides broken down and revealing the immense cup-shaped
hollow within. The aneroid showed that the surface of
the lake was twenty-six hundred feet above the sea, about
nineteen hundred feet below the height of the capital.</p>

<p>We waited and waited on the shore, sweeping the opposite
banks with our telescopes for signs of approaching canoes, but
looked in vain; nothing like a canoe was to be seen, and the
waves got higher and higher; evidently it would not have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
safe to cross so late in the day, when the sea breeze, as is the
case also on the coast lagoons, makes a considerable swell, and
crossing is practicable only for the largest canoes. And while
we are waiting, we may remark that this Lake Alaotra is the
largest one in Madagascar, and is about twenty-five miles long,
by four or five in average breadth. But as the level marshy
land to the west and south is only a few inches above its surface,
the lake is of much greater extent in the wet season. It receives
the drainage of the northern portion of the Ankay plain, so that
a considerable body of water must issue from its north-eastern
arm and flow towards the sea. According to the Rev. L.
Dahle, the name “Alaotra” is probably the Arabic <em>Al-lutat</em>,
“the dashing of the waves,” the sea. The Arabs of the
Comoro Islands and East Africa are known among the Malagasy
as the “Taloatra”—<em>i.e.</em> “those from beyond the ocean.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">IRRITATING DELAY</div>

<p>The afternoon wore on; the doctor took photographs of the
opposite shore; Mr Pillans and I took bearings for the map,
and collected shells; and at last, after waiting two hours, we
reluctantly came to the conclusion that we must go back to the
village in the swamp, which we accordingly did. However, we
were not so uncomfortable as we had feared, nor did we take
any harm from the damp conditions. The head people came to
present beef, etc., but I fear I answered them rather curtly, for
we saw plainly it was never intended to let us get over the lake
until the following day; but, with the usual native unwillingness
to speak out plainly, they would not say so to begin with. In
the book which Dr Mullens wrote on his return to England he
says of this afternoon’s experiences: “I am afraid that the
general depression seriously interfered with the reply of our
friend, Mr Sibree. The dignity and fulness with which he
usually dwelt upon the affairs of the kingdom and the health of
the authorities, and the flowery eloquence with which he would
describe the purpose of our visit, entirely failed him here. His
reply was brief and guarded, and the two-pounder gun he
passed over in total silence.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DEEP LAKE</div>

<p>On Wednesday morning we left Ambòhitsàra at half-past
six, so as to cross the lake as soon after sunrise as possible, as
this is always the calmest time of the day in Madagascar
waters. We found about a dozen large canoes waiting for
us; several of these were from thirty to forty feet long,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
and three to four feet beam, hollowed out of a single tree.
We all embarked and got off soon after half-past seven, but the
wind had already risen somewhat, and there was quite a swell
on the water. But the sail across was most delightful. As we
proceeded, the northern shores opened up, showing two deep
bays stretching far away between the hills, and an island, where
the Sihànaka made their last stand in resisting Hova domination.
From that time it has not been allowed to be inhabited,
but is only used for planting vegetables. We had only two
paddlers, one at the head, and the other at the stern of the
canoe, and so were an hour and ten minutes in crossing. We
made an attempt to ascertain the depth of the lake with an old
knife as a sinker, and a piece of string as a line, while the doctor,
in true scientific fashion, “hove the lead.” I regret to say that
no accurate information was obtained, for the sounding line was
again and again thrown with the report, “no bottom.” But our
short line was no doubt the reason of our ill-success. The lake
is probably deep at its northern end, and it is certainly shallow
at its southern extremity, gradually changing into marsh. Some
of my missionary friends, who subsequently lived in Antsihànaka,
have described voyages across the southern end of the
Alaotra, where, amongst the dense growth of papyrus, rush, and
tall grasses, the only practicable paths for a canoe are dark
passages, almost tunnel-like, among the rank vegetation; and
where a stranger might easily be lost in the watery and reedy
wastes around him.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the present lake is but a small
remnant of a much larger one; for, at a not very distant
period, the water must have covered the whole plain of Antsihànaka,
thus forming a lake five or six times the size of the
present Alaotra. But at a yet earlier period still, this lake
extended for a hundred miles farther south, down the Ankay
plain, and for at least two hundred miles farther north,
forming an immense extent of water, not much unlike the
Tànganyika in Central Africa in size and outline, and of considerable
depth; for Mr Baron found numerous indications of
old shore-lines at elevations of eleven to twelve hundred feet
above the present level. Doubtless, the gradual lowering of
the valleys of the Mangòro to the south, and of the Màningòry
to the north-east, drained off this great lake, leaving only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
the present comparatively small sheet of water as its
representative.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BIRD LIFE</div>

<p>To an ordinary observer the Alaotra lake presents a good
deal of bird life, as well as the large reptiles which bask in the
sun on its shores. But to those who will examine more closely
and will use a good microscope, there are minute forms of life,
both animal and vegetable, which are wonderful for their
beauty and their variety. Among the latter are the Algæ, of
which my late friend, Mr Baron, made a collection, mostly from
the neighbourhood of Alaotra, including a hundred and eighty
species, of which seventy proved to be new to science. In a
quarto pamphlet of fifty pages, with plates of two hundred
different figures, these fresh-water algæ were minutely described,
as belonging to thirteen different orders and thirty-one
genera.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Many new and interesting species were thus revealed,
and considerable additional knowledge of the distribution of
known forms attained. Without actual inspection of the
plates it is difficult to give any clear notion of the various
remarkable, often strange, and frequently beautiful forms of
these lowly organised plants as revealed by the microscope.
The bi-lobed outlines of the <i>Cosmaria</i> are especially noticeable,
and hardly less so are the stellate, triangular and multangular
forms of other species. It is difficult to believe that some of
these remarkable organisms are plants at all; in many cases
they are more like some beautiful shell, delicately and elaborately
sculptured; while in others they take the form of a
simple cell—round, oval or triangular—often as if about to
increase by fissure; while others again have curious processes,
more like those of some grotesque polyp than anything belonging
to the vegetable kingdom. These plants are additional illustrations
of the wonders that lie hidden from ordinary observation
in the mud of almost every pond and in the slime that gathers
round almost every water-plant.</p>

<p>It is a rather interesting fact that the crocodile found in the
Alaotra is a different species to that inhabiting all the rivers
of Madagascar; but it is identical with the crocodile found
fossil, together with the remains of the extinct hippopotamus
and the gigantic birds and lemurs which inhabited the island
probably until the appearance of man upon the scene. These
reptiles are very numerous in the lake, for in the afternoons, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
the small rocky islets which rise only a little above the water,
the crocodiles are seen snapping at each other to get space to
bask in the sun. In the small streams flowing into Alaotra they
are numerous at all times of the day, so that if there are only
a few canoes, people dare not cross for fear of being upset.
Tortoises are also plentiful on the shores and islets of the lake.
Two species of water-lily are found in the water, one being
identical with the lotus of the Nile; besides these there are
numerous other water-plants, one being a twining plant,
called <em>Tsihìtafòtotra</em> (“the root not seen”), which twines about
other plants in all possible directions, clinging to them by
numerous little disks; and there are also two species of convolvulus
(<em>Ipomæa</em>), with large red flowers. Besides the masses
of papyrus (<em>zozòro</em>) and <em>hèrana</em> sedge, growing in the marshes
and shallow parts of the lake, a gigantic and handsome grass,
called <em>Bàraràta</em>, growing from twelve to fifteen feet high, is very
abundant. It would be taken by ordinary people for a species
of bamboo, for its size and the thickness of its jointed stem; its
sharp prickly leaf sheaths near the root make it very unpleasant
for the unshod feet of the natives. In and about the marshes
occur the <em>Jaboàdy</em>, a species of wild cat, and also a kind of muskrat,
both of strong scent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MYTHICAL CREATURES</div>

<p>There are certain mythical creatures firmly believed by the
Sihànaka to exist in Lake Alaotra. One of these is a monster
having seven heads and known as <em>Fanànim-pìto-lòha</em>. It is said
to be a sort of serpent, and when it lifts itself out of the water,
as it does occasionally, its head touches the sky! There are
also <em>Andrìambàviràno</em> (<em>lit.</em> “water-princesses”). These creatures,
though residing beneath the water, never get wet, as they
live in water-tight palaces. They are said to have hair reaching
down to the waist. Veritable water-nymphs these!</p>

<div class="sidenote">A GRATIFYING CHANGE</div>

<p>But to return to our journey, we landed at the foot of the hill
on which Ambòhitsòa, a village of about eighty houses, is built,
and mounted to the top by a steep pathway. Here a most
extensive and lovely view presented itself, I think <em>the</em> most
beautiful of its kind I had ever seen in Madagascar. The
lake lay before us, stretching far away to the southward in a
great rounded curve, and with its indented bays and island
fastness to the northward. The changing shades of purple and
blue of the water; the green of the plain beyond; and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
varied outline of hills and mountains in the far background to
west and north—all lit up by bright sunshine—made as charming
a picture as an artist could desire to transfer to canvas. But
we had little time to spare, and so after hastily taking bearings
we went to Màrosalàzana, the next village to the south, which
we could see on a high hill at three or four miles’ distance. On
entering the village, a place with about sixty houses, we found
a crowd of about four hundred people waiting to receive us.
These were not all inhabitants of the place, for many of them had
come from Ambòhitsòa to meet us. After a formal reception
by the authorities we found the school-children assembled on an
open raised space in the centre of the village, a group of nearly
a hundred altogether, dressed in their best. Many of the girls
had a peculiar kind of collar to their dress, consisting of seven
or eight massive silver chains of different patterns; they also
wore armlets of silver. Many of these children and young
people had most intelligent and pleasant faces. We heard them
read, and then I was delighted to find they knew the smaller
catechism well. I talked to them a little about it, and then
addressed a few words to the numbers of people crowded round
the children, speaking to them of the great love of God in sending
His Son. It was an interesting scene, and one we did not soon
forget: the bright intelligent group of children in the centre;
the crowd of wondering Sihànaka on each side; the little knots
of women in their dark blue dresses and silver ornaments; and
the lovely scene around us—all made a picture attractive in its
outward aspects, but still more interesting when one thought
of these people as seemingly prepared to welcome a fuller
teaching than they had yet received.</p>

<p>The pleasant scene at this village, as well as what we had
witnessed at others, gave a cheering promise of what might be
expected were the people more thoroughly instructed. In a
short report supplied by Rabé, the native evangelist, he says
that when he first went to Antsihànaka, “only a person could
be found here and there who washed their clothes, for everyone’s
dress was smeared with castor-oil, and they thought it would
spoil their clothes to wash them, as they would soon be worn
out; so that the clothing of the people was offensive to the last
degree. For that reason the dark blue cotton was generally
worn, as it was nearly black to begin with. But now there is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
hardly anyone who does not wash his clothes, and has not white
dress. Not long ago, when it was evening, the young men in
the villages used to form into two parties, and had violent
boxing-matches all through the village, the women also often
joining in the fray. But now no one practises this rough sport.
Not long ago rum was what the people chiefly delighted in; and
if any strangers who visited them were not made thoroughly
drunk, the owner of the house was looked upon as inhospitable,
although he gave them the best of everything to eat.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXPENSIVE FUNERALS</div>

<p>We left Màrosalàzana at one o’clock, and found outside the
village something which gives the explanation of its name,
“many poles”—viz. a group of more than twenty poles stuck
in the ground close together, and holding ox skulls and horns.
This was the largest group we had yet seen, and there also were
many more lying mouldering on the ground. Besides these,
there were several very high poles with forked tops, such as
we had already seen at almost all the Sihànaka villages. These
lofty poles are called <em>jìro</em>, a word which in Hova Malagasy
signifies a “lamp.” We had already seen these on our journey
northwards, but here was a larger number than we had hitherto
met with. These <em>jìro</em> are only raised in memory of a <em>male</em>
Sihànaka; to eulogise a woman, the rush mats and baskets
which she made and possessed while living are arranged on poles
by the wayside to meet the public gaze. These people spend
a large amount of money and property on the funerals of their
relatives. Mr Pearse gives the following account of what was
expended at that of a man dying at a village called Màngalàza:—Thirty
silk <em>làmbas</em>, to wrap up the corpse, value two
hundred and sixty-nine dollars; a hundred oxen, value three
hundred dollars; drink and food, principally the former,
thirty-nine dollars’ worth; showing an expenditure of more
than six hundred dollars on this particular funeral. (At that
time a dollar was worth as much or more to the Malagasy as
a pound would be to us.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">A WIDOW</div>

<p>After returning home from Antsihànaka, I heard many other
particulars about the people and their habits, and among them
the following curious, and cruel, custom with regard to widows;
and as this is so utterly different from anything practised by any
other Malagasy tribe, as far as I am aware, it is well to put
it on record. It is much more like a Hindu custom than a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
Malagasy one, and is as follows:—When the corpse of the
deceased husband is about to be buried, the widow is decorated
profusely with all the ornaments she possesses, wearing a
scarlet <em>làmba</em>, with beads and silver chains on her neck and
wrists and ankles, long ear-rings depending from her ears to
her shoulders, and silver ornaments on her head. Then she is
placed in the house, so that it may be seen by everyone how
her husband adorned her while he was yet living; and when
the people go away to the funeral, she remains still in the
house, and does not go to the grave. When the relatives and
friends have returned home and seen the widow sitting in her
grand clothing and ornaments, they rush upon her, tearing her
dress and violently pulling off her ornaments, so as to hurt her,
and say at the same time: “This is the cause of our losing our
relative”; for they believe that the <em>vìntana</em>—<em>i.e.</em> fate or luck
of the wife—is stronger than that of her husband and so has
caused his death. Then they give her a coarse <em>làmba</em>, a spoon
with a broken handle, and a round dish with the stand broken
off; her hair is dishevelled, and she is covered up with a coarse
mat; and under it she remains all day long, and can only leave
it at night; and whoever goes into the house, the widow may
not speak to them. She is not allowed to wash her face or her
hands, but only the tips of her fingers. She endures all this
sometimes for a year, or at least for eight months; and even
then, her time of mourning is not ended, but endures for a considerable
time afterwards. And she is not allowed to go home
to her own relatives until she has been divorced first by the
husband’s family.</p>

<p>The house in which people die is left by the survivors, and
no one occupies it again; they do not pull it down, but let it
fall to pieces of itself, but they do not leave the village as do
the Sàkalàva in similar circumstances. Such houses are called
<em>tràno fòlaka</em> (“broken houses”); but I am informed that this
last custom is falling into disuse; and happily, the influence of
Christian teaching has caused the treatment of widows to be
greatly altered, so that it is now becoming a thing of the past.</p>

<p>After leaving the “village of many poles,” our afternoon
journey was southward, first crossing several spurs of the higher
hills with their intermediate valleys; and then down a long
level tract of country between the lake and a bold wall-like line<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
of hills, which here forms the eastern boundary of the plain. We
passed several large villages, and stopped for the night at a place
of forty or fifty houses, called Ambòhimànga.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNLUCKY DAYS</div>

<p>In one of the villages situated in the dense papyrus thickets
which cover the marshes to the south of the lake, a place called
Ànoròro, lives a strange tribe of people who seem quite
isolated, not only in their dwelling-place, but also in their
barbarous habits, from the other Sihànaka, and who speak a
distinctly different dialect. In the rainy season, when the
water rises, it enters into the houses of these people, and they
then put together several layers of <em>zozòro</em> to form a kind of raft,
so that as the water rises, this raft rises with it. Upon these
<em>zozòro</em> they make their hearths and their beds; and there they
live, rising and falling with the water, until the rainy season is
over and they can live on the ground again. There are some
curious stories about the simplicity of these people and their
fathers, for they have no intercourse with anyone outside their
village except on a certain day, when they go out to sell the
fish they have caught. These people appear to have no fewer
than eight unlucky days in each month, so that during more
than a quarter of their time their superstition prevents them
from going about or engaging in any work.</p>

<p>While speaking of unlucky days, it must be here noticed that
all over Antsihànaka, Thursday is considered as <em>fàdy</em> (tabooed),
and no one will work their rice-fields on that day. To build
brick or clay houses is not permitted, death being the supposed
penalty in case of transgression. To use hemp also, either in
the form of cloth, or for smoking, is also universally tabooed.
And besides the <em>fàdy</em> common to all Sihànaka, each family or
clan has inherited a set of <em>fàdy</em> of its own, so that in addition to
the universal abstinence from work on Thursday, there will be
another day of the week on which nothing may be taken out of
the house, the mats may not be swept, etc. Various foods and
actions, too numerous to particularise, are <em>fàdy</em> to certain
villages; while considered quite harmless in some places, they
would bring all manner of evil in others.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning we set off again, and after two hours’
journey along the east edge of the plain, left it and made a
straight course over the rice-fields for Ambàtondrazàka, leaving
the great semicircular bay to the east of the town on our left.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
We got in at ten o’clock, all very wet with the heavy drizzle,
but we were soon comfortably settled in the chapel, and got
our things dried in the sun. We were again most kindly
received by the officers and the congregation there, but we were
obliged to leave soon, so as to get back to Antanànarìvo for some
important engagements. On consultation with our bearers, we
found that they were willing to make a long journey for a day
or two (encouraged also thereto by promises of an extra day’s
pay), so that we might get quickly over the uninhabited country,
and reach Anjozòrobé by Saturday afternoon. So we left Ambàtondrazàka
at midday and arrived at Màngantàny by sunset.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BEAUTY OF THE GRASS</div>

<p>Again were we charmed with the varied scenery of the route,
and especially by the grasses, about which I have already spoken
in this chapter, and which Dr Mullens graphically describes in
a passage which may well conclude this account of our Antsihànaka
journey. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I received the impression, afterwards repeatedly confirmed,
that one of the most beautiful things to be
found in Madagascar is its grass. It is beautiful in the
sheltered valleys, where the tender blades, enriched by the
dew and the rain, are refreshing to the eye, and yield like
velvet to the foot. But here the grass is in its glory on the
great hills. Burnt year after year by long sweeping fires, it
springs up again with a profusion which clasps huge rocks within
its soft embrace. Here it is short but strong; there it rises in
vast tufts, each of which contains many thousand blades and
covers many feet of ground; and yet again it spreads over vast
patches of country in thick, tall masses, which tower above
men’s heads, open their tinted blades to the warm sun, and
wave their myriads of golden feathers in the summer winds.
And it is when we contemplate this rich but simple provision of
the divine bounty, when we watch these masses of slender
blades, each tuft a forest in itself, clothing with beauty what
man has neglected, laying up store for man and beast, opening
their golden hair to the dews by night and the warm winds by
day, and joyously revelling in the life given them from above,
that then we can, with Mr Ruskin, appreciate and share the
admiration and the praise given by the Psalmist to Him ‘Who
maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains.’”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">“NO MAN’S LAND”</div>

<p>The following day we had a long journey over “no man’s
land,” taking provisions with us and stopping to dine by a
stream half-way, and reached Mandànivàtsy before nightfall.
Saturday morning we crossed the high ridge in the forest,
entering Imèrina again, and got to Anjozòrobé in good time in
the afternoon. After the fatigues of the week we had another
pleasant Sabbath, the first of the month, with the good people
there. Monday evening brought us to Ambòhitrérana, and a
couple of hours’ ride on Tuesday morning took us home to
Ambòhimànga in time for breakfast; thus completing in little
more than nineteen days our very interesting journey and
exploration.</p>


<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> Among the Sàkalàva, <em>Alaotra</em> means “ocean” or “sea,” so
that it is the sea-like sheet of water. <em>Cf.</em> the use of <em>Bahr</em>
among the Arabs, in <em>Bahr-Tabariyeh</em>, Sea of Tiberias, and <em>Bahr-Lut</em>,
Sea of Lot—Dead Sea.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> It is a significant fact that the Malagasy word for “glory,”
“honour,” is <em>vòninàhitra</em>, which, literally translated, is “flower
of the grass.” Did this expression arise from the native
admiration of some of these beautiful grasses, similar to that
which so excited Dr Mullens’ delight when travelling in this
country.</p>

<span class="fs70">LAKE ITÀSY</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">MADAGASCAR is not at present one of those regions
of the earth where volcanic disturbances occur; but
there is ample evidence, from the numerous extinct
craters found in various parts of the island, that at a very
recent period, geologically considered—possibly even within the
occupation of the country by its present inhabitants—it was
the theatre of very extensive outbursts of subterranean
energy. The whole island has not yet been examined with
sufficient minuteness to determine the exact extent of these
old volcanoes, but they have been observed from near the
south-east coast in South Latitude 28°, and in various
parts of the centre of the island up to the north-west
and extreme north, a distance of six hundred and eighty
miles; and probably a more complete survey would reveal
other links connecting more closely what is, as at present
known, only a series of isolated groups of extinct craters.
In the central provinces of Madagascar there are two large
clusters of old volcanic cones and vents: one of them in
about the same latitude as the capital (19° South), but
from fifty to seventy miles away to the west of it, in
the neighbourhood of Lake Itàsy; the other in the district
called Vàkinankàratra, situated about eighty miles to the
south-south-west of Antanànarìvo, and south-west of the great
central mountain mass of Ankàratra.</p>

<p>This second volcanic region stretches from twenty to thirty
miles from Antsìrabé away west to Bétàfo and beyond it, and
contains numerous and prominent extinct craters, some of
which have been described by the graphic pen of the late Dr
Mullens in his “Twelve Months in Madagascar” (pp. 214-219).
The doctor says that he counted in this southern group about
sixty cones and craters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MAGNIFICENT VIEW</div>

<p>The Itàsy just referred to is a lake situated about fifty-five<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
miles west of Antanànarìvo, and is about five miles long from
east to west, and three miles from north to south. It is irregularly
square in outline, several small headlands breaking up its
shores into little bays; while to the north, where the river
Lilìa takes its overflow to the sea, is a long extension or arm
of the lake, curving round a mountain, which proves to be an
old volcano. Seen from the east, as I approached it from the
capital, it appeared as if in a depression of the general surface,
and its waters were of a lovely blue. A still finer view of it is
obtained from a mountain called Ambòhimiangàra, which is
about three miles distant from it to the north-east. This is by
far the highest point for a long distance around the lake; and
as we proceeded towards it during our two days’ journey from
Antanànarìvo, its great rounded mass gradually rose and
dominated the whole landscape.</p>

<p>A late friend of mine, who resided long in the district, wrote
of Ambòhimiangàra as “a kingly hill, higher by head and
shoulders than any other near it, its crown of white stones
rising some eighteen hundred feet above the lake lying blue at its
feet. The view from the summit was magnificent, the centre
of the whole being the lovely Itàsy embosomed in its bright
green hills, a pearl encircled with emeralds, with mountains
upon mountains in every direction as far as eye could reach.
Fierce thunderstorms were being marshalled hither and thither,
and could be counted by the half-dozen wherever the eye turned.
The whole mountain is a mass of quartz; where the rocks
protrude it is toned down to silver-grey by lichens, but where
the rain has washed it away, it appears as coarse sand and
pebbles of the purest white, with an occasional speck of pink.... We
had a good ride, after our descent, along the north-western
arm of the lake. This end of Itàsy, forming, as it were,
a little lake by itself, and reflecting the deep blue and white of
the sky above it, lay calm in the bright sunshine, encircled by
the green hills, while clusters of houses, embowered in peach and
other trees, grouped themselves around its shores. Here and
there a canoe’s dark line among the sedges showed where the
fisher was at work with hook and line; and across the meadow
to the right, a herd of cattle was slowly wending its way to fresh
pastures. Altogether, it formed a most inviting subject for a
picture.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>Some way down the river flowing from the north-western arm
of the lake is a very beautiful waterfall. The river, broken into
three streams, falls in foaming white masses over a ledge of
black lava, some fifty feet deep. The whole bed of the river for
a mile above is of the same black character, the lava broken into
innumerable blocks and setting off the vivid colour of the
verdure on the river banks. The people say that Itàsy was
once only a huge swamp, and its becoming a clear lake is within
the memory, or perhaps the traditions, of the inhabitants.
Other legends relate that the lake was formed by a Vazìmba
chieftain, named Rapèto, damming up the river flowing from
the swamp; and so the rice-fields of a neighbouring chief, with
whom he was at variance, were flooded and have ever since
remained under water. There is doubtless an element of truth
in this latter account; but the chieftain, also supposed to be a
giant, was not a human being, but a volcano, which broke out
at the north-western corner and dammed up the river for a long
period, as shown by the lava in its bed, as just described. The
river has now cut its way several feet through the barrier which
was thus thrown across its course.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLAMINGOES</div>

<p>I spent several hours one day in a canoe on the lake with a
friend, shooting wild duck (my first and my last exploit in this
line). We found birds very abundant on the water, and in the
swamps and rank vegetation along the shores. Flamingoes,
with their white plumage and pink tinge pervading the whole
under part of the wings, are fairly common here, and are said to
be extremely good eating. The native name for this bird,
<em>Sàmaka</em>, is appropriate and descriptive, as it means “disjointed,”
“split,” referring to its immensely long legs. It is also called
<em>Amjòmbona</em>, from its trumpeting cry, this being also the native
name for a large species of triton shell used as a trumpet. An
adult male bird stands more than four feet high; and when on
the defensive these birds make quite a loud noise by sharply
opening and closing their beaks, which are long and powerful.
When on the wing, they fly exceedingly high.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RAIL</div>

<p>Among the many birds frequenting this lake and the neighbourhood
are the purple water-hens, of which three species are
found in Madagascar. They are of a rich bluish-purple colour,
and have a very powerful beak, with which they easily root up
the Hèrana sedge, when growing on the edge of the lake in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
shallow water. They do this for the sake of the tender rootlets,
and perhaps also for insects. Of the jacanas, two species are
found here; with their extremely long toes they walk easily
upon the large leaves of aquatic plants, seeking for the water-insects
which form their food. They dive with great ease and
are therefore very difficult to shoot. Six or seven species of
rail have been observed in the island; the most common one
(<i>Rallus gularis</i>) is regarded with great respect, as it is believed
to bring rain in dry weather. Its loud whistling and tremulous
cry is heard chiefly towards evening. These birds are said to be
so careful of their eggs and young that they may easily be taken
by the hand from the nest. M. Pollen says: “I once saw a
hen-bird who would not quit the space near her nest, but kept
walking around it, ruffling her feathers, and dragging her wings
on the ground, in the same way as our domestic hen does when
defending her young. Other birds common to the marshy
districts are crested coots, curlews, snipe and plovers. Two
species of birds peculiar to Madagascar, for whom a special
family had to be formed, can only be spoken of by their scientific
name of <i>Mesites</i>; they are very curious and specialised birds,
taking their place between the rails and the herons.” According
to the native accounts, when the nests of these mesites,
which are mostly placed on a low situation, are flooded, the
parent birds drag them to where they will be free from injury
by the water. If anyone takes their young, they follow them
into the village; and on account of this love for their offspring
they are considered sacred (<em>fàdy</em>), because, say the natives,
they are in this like human beings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOT MINERAL WATERS</div>

<p>Not very far to the east of the second group of old volcanoes
mentioned above is the large village of Antsìrabé (“much
salt”), which is about seventy-five miles south-west of Antanànarìvo,
and is now on the automobile road to the Bétsiléo
province. At this place one of the chief springs is largely
charged with lime, which has formed an extensive deposit all
over a small level valley sunk some twenty feet below the
general level of the plain around the village. For a long time
this place furnished almost all the lime used for building in the
capital and in the central province of Imèrina. Besides the
deposit over the floor of the valley, there was also a compact
ridge-shaped mass of lime accretion, seventy feet long by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
eighteen to twenty feet wide, and about fifteen or sixteen feet
high. This had all been deposited by the spring, which kept
open a passage through the lime to the top. Some years ago,
however, the spring was tapped by a shaft, of no great depth, a
few yards to the north, over which a large and commodious
bath-house was erected by the Norwegian Lutheran Mission;
and here many visitors came to bathe in the hot mineral water,
which has been found very beneficial in rheumatic and other
complaints.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> A little distance to the south-west is another
spring, not, however, hot, but only milk-warm, the water of
which is drunk by those who bathe in the other spring. This
water has been shown to be, in chemical constituents, almost
identical with the famous Vichy water of France. All over the
valley the water oozes up in various places; and about half-a-mile
farther north are several other springs, somewhat hotter
than that just described, to which the natives largely resort
for curative bathing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXTINCT HIPPOPOTAMI</div>

<p>During the excavations for the foundations of the bath-house,
the skeletons of several examples of an extinct species of
hippopotamus were discovered, the crania and tusks being in
very perfect preservation. Some of these are now in the
museum at Berlin; the finest specimen was sent to the museum
of the University of Christiania in Norway. This Madagascar
hippopotamus was a smaller species than that now living in
Africa, and is probably nearly allied to, if not identical with,
another hippopotamus (<i>H. Lemerlei</i>), of which remains were
found in 1868 by M. Grandidier, in the plains of the south-west
coast. I was informed by the people that, wherever in these
valleys the black mud is dug into for a depth of three or four feet,
bones are sure to be met with. From the internal structure
of the teeth and bones of the hippopotami discovered at Antsìrabé,
traces of the gelatine being still visible, it is evident that
the animals had been living at a comparatively recent period.
There have been occasional vague reports of the existence of
some large animal in the southern parts of the island; and
perhaps the half-mythical stories of the <em>Sòngòmby</em>, <em>Tòkandìa</em>,
<em>Làlomèna</em>, and other strange creatures current among the
Malagasy, are traditions of the period when these pachyderms
were still to be seen in the lakes and streams and marshes of
Madagascar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>Besides the remains of hippopotami, Mr Rosaas, for many
years a missionary of the Norwegian Society, and stationed at
Antsìrabé, obtained considerable quantities of the bones of
extinct gigantic birds. It is about eighty years ago (<em>circa</em>
1834 and 1835) since it became known to naturalists, through
the discovery of portions of massive leg-bones and fragments of
enormous eggs, that there was evidence of the former existence
in Madagascar of large birds. For a quarter-century after that
date, the dislike of the heathen queen to all foreign influence
prevented fuller investigations of a scientific character. But
since the year 1861 further researches, and excavations made
in widely separated localities, have shown that several species
of these great birds existed until a comparatively recent period
in many parts of the island. It was evident that they were
flightless, and were allied to the ostrich, and still more closely
to the recently extinct <i>Dinornis</i> of New Zealand. The generic
name of <i>Æpyornis</i> was given to these birds, of which several
species were discovered, ranging in size from that of a bustard
to a bird exceeding an ostrich in height and also in the massive
character of the skeleton. The largest species was accordingly
named <i>Æpyornis maximus</i>. Subsequently, the remains of still
larger birds were discovered and these were called <i>Æ. titan</i> and
<i>Æ. ingens</i>, the largest of them being about ten feet in height.
More recent and exact examination has shown that the <em>twelve</em>
species which had been formed must be reduced to a smaller
number, as some of the lesser kinds have been proved to be
young and immature forms of the larger species. From the
collection of hundreds of bones, and, in a very few cases, complete
skeletons, it is now clear that several species of these great
birds once roamed over the marshes and valleys of Madagascar,
as the ostrich does still in Africa, and the cassowary in Australia
and some East Indian islands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXTINCT ANIMALS</div>

<p>The egg of one of the species, probably of the largest one, is
the largest of all known eggs, its longer axis being twelve and
a quarter inches, and the shorter one nine and three-eighths
inches; it thus had a capacity equal to six ostrich eggs, and to
one hundred and forty-eight of those of the domestic fowl.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
From the marks of cutting with a sharp instrument seen on
some of the bones, it seems highly probable that these great
birds, as well as the hippopotamus, gigantic tortoises, and other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
animals, were living when the first human inhabitants of the
island appeared upon the scene; and doubtless this was also
the reason of the disappearance of both birds and beasts, as
they were hunted and used for food.</p>

<span class="fs70">VOLCANIC DISTRICT</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">WITHIN a few miles of Antsìrabé are two crater lakes.
The nearer and larger of these is called Andraikìba,
which lies distant about four miles due west. This
is a beautiful sheet of water, blue as the heavens in colour, in
shape an irregular square, but curving round to the north-west,
where it shallows into a marsh, which is finally absorbed in rice-fields.
The lake is said to be of profound depth, but the hills
surrounding it are not very lofty, rising only about two hundred
feet above the surface of the water, from which they ascend
steeply. Fish and water-fowl, and crocodiles also, are very
abundant in and on its waters.</p>

<p>But the most interesting natural curiosity to be seen in the
neighbourhood of Antsìrabé is the crater-lake of Trìtrìva.
This is situated about ten miles to the south-west, a pleasant
ride of two hours by palanquin. Travelling at first in a westerly
direction, the road then turns more to the south-west, and skirts
the southern foot of the old volcano of Vòhitra. Passing about
a mile or two south of the high ground round the southern
shores of the Andraikìba lake, the road gradually ascends to a
higher level of country, so that in about an hour and a half’s
time we are nearly as high as the top of Vòhitra—probably
about five hundred feet. Reaching a ridge between two
prominent hills, we catch our first sight of Trìtrìva, now from
two to three miles distant in front of us. From this point it
shows very distinctly as an oval-shaped hill, its longest axis
lying north and south, and with a great depression in its centre,
the north-eastern edge of the crater wall being the lowest part
of it, from which point it rises gradually southwards and westwards,
the western edge being at the centre from two to three
times the height of the eastern side. To the north are two
much smaller cup-like hills, looking as if the volcanic forces, after
the main crater had been formed, had become weaker and so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
been unable to discharge any longer by the old vent, and had
therefore formed two newer outlets at a lower level.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN OLD VOLCANO</div>

<p>Descending a little from the ridge just mentioned, we cross a
valley with a good many scattered hamlets, and in less than
half-an-hour reach the foot of the hill. A few minutes’ pull up
a tolerably easy slope, perhaps two hundred feet in height,
brings up to the top, at the lowest part of the crater edge; and
on reaching the ridge the crater of the old volcano and its lake
is before us, or, rather, below us. It is certainly an extraordinary
scene. The inner sides of the crater dip down very
steeply on all sides to a deep gulf, and here, sharply defined by
perpendicular cliffs all round it, except just at the southern
point, is a rather weird-looking dark green lake far below us,
the water surface being probably from two hundred to three
hundred feet lower than the point we are standing upon, and
consequently below the level of the surrounding country. The
lake, exactly shut in by the cliffs of the crater surrounding it, is
not blue in colour, like Andraikìba, although under a bright and
cloudless sky, but a deep and somewhat blackish-green. It
must look, one would suppose, like ink under a stormy sky or in
the shadows of evening.</p>

<p>We sit down to rest and try to take in all the details of this
novel picture. It is undoubtedly an old volcano we are now
looking down into; the spot on which we rest is only a few feet
in breadth, and we can see that this narrow knife-edge is the
same all round the crater. Outside of it the slope is pretty easy,
but inside it descends steeply, here and there precipitously, to
the edge of the cliffs which so sharply define the actual vent
and, as distinctly, the lake which they enclose. Looking
southwards, the crater edge gradually ascends, winding round
the southern side, and still ascending as the eye follows it to the
western, the opposite side, where the crater wall towers steeply
up from two hundred to three hundred feet higher than it does
on the east, where we are standing. The lake we judge to be
about eight hundred to nine hundred feet long and two hundred
to two hundred and fifty feet wide, forming a long oval, with
pointed ends. The cliffs which enclose it appear to be from
forty to fifty feet in height, whitish in colour, but with black
streaks, where the rain, charged with carbonic acid, has poured
more plentifully down their faces. These cliffs are vertical and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
in some places overhang the water, and from their apparently
horizontal stratification are no doubt of gneiss rock. In coming
up the hill I noticed a few small lumps of gneiss among the
basaltic lava pebbles. The strongest feature of Trìtrìva is the
sharply defined vertical opening of the vent, looking as if the
rocks had been cut <em>clean through</em> with an enormous chisel, and
as if they must dip down—as is the case—to profound depths
below the dusky green waters. At the northern end of the lake
is a deep gorge or cleft, partly filled with bushes and other
vegetation. Southward of this, on the eastern side, the cliffs
are still lofty and overhang the water, but at about a third of
the lake’s length they gradually decrease in height, and at the
southern point they dip down to the level of the lake, so that at
that part only can the water be approached. On the western
side the cliffs keep a pretty uniform height all along the whole
length.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CRATER</div>

<p>So steep is the inward slope of the crater walls that we all
experienced a somewhat “eerie” feeling in walking along the
footpath at its edge; for at a very few feet from this a false step
would set one rolling downwards, with nothing to break the
descent to the edge of the cliffs, and then to the dark waters
below. Yet there was a strange fascination in the scene, and
the variety and contrast and depth of the colours would make
the Trìtrìva lake and slopes a striking subject for a painting
from many different points along its crater wall. When we
arrived, the sun, yet wanting an hour and a half of noon, was
still lighting up the grey-white stone of the western cliffs, but
the shadows were every minute growing more intense as the sun
became more nearly vertical. Far below us was the deep green
oval lake; above it, the stratified gneiss cliffs with their black
streaks, diversified here and there by patches of bright green
bush. Then again from their edges sweep steeply upwards
the grey-green sides of the crater, culminating in the lofty
western ridge opposite to us. And over all was the blue sky
flecked with cirrus clouds; altogether a scene such as I
have seen nowhere else in Madagascar, or indeed in any other
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A ROMANCE</div>

<p>After fixing in our minds the view from the north-east, we
proceeded southwards along the crater edge to the higher part
at the south-east, where the view is equally striking, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
depth of the great chasm seems still more profound. Here
we waited some time, while most of our men went down to one
of the hamlets in the plain to the east to get their meal, in which
quest, however, they had only poor success. On expressing a
wish to taste the Trìtrìva water, one of our bearers took a glass,
and descending by a breakneck path, went to fetch some water
from the lake. He was so long away that we were beginning to
feel uneasy, but after a quarter of an hour he reappeared with
the water, which tasted perfectly sweet and good. He also
entertained us with some of the legends which were certain
to have grown up about so weird-looking a place as Trìtrìva.
Pointing to two or three small trees or bushes growing on the
face of the cliffs near the northern point of the lake, he told us
these were really a young lad and lass who had become attached
to each other; but the hard-hearted parents of the girl disapproving
of the match, the youth took his loin-cloth, and
binding it round his sweetheart and his own body, precipitated
her with himself into the dark waters. They became, so it is
said, two trees growing side by side, and they now have offspring,
for a young tree is growing near them; and in proof
of the truth of this story, he said that if you pinch or break
the branches of these trees, it is not sap which exudes, but
blood. He appeared to believe firmly in the truth of this
story.</p>

<p>He also told us that the people of a clan called Zànatsàra,
who live in the neighbourhood, claim some special rights in the
Trìtrìva lake; and when any one of their number is ill they
send to see if the usually clear dark green of the water is becoming
brown and turbid. If this is the case they believe it to be a
presage of death to the sick person.</p>

<p>Another legend makes the lake the former home of one of the
mythical monsters of Malagasy folk-lore, the <em>Fanànim-pìto-lòha</em>
or “seven-headed serpent.” But for some reason or other he
grew tired of his residence, and shifted his quarters to the more
spacious and brighter lodgings for seven-headed creatures
afforded by the other volcanic lake of Andraikìba.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Water-Carriers</span><br />

The woman with a baby on her back has a full pitcher simply balanced on her head</div>
</div>

<p>This same bearer assured us that in the rainy season—contrary
to what one would have supposed—the water of the lake
diminishes, but increases again in the dry season. He told us
that there is an outlet to the water, which forms a spring to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
north of the mountain. I noticed a white line a foot or two
above the surface of the water all round the foot of the cliffs,
showing a probably higher level than at the time of our visit.
It was popularly supposed to be unfathomable, but some years
after my visit the Rev. Johannes Johnson, of the Norwegian
Mission, sounded the lake in three places. The deepest portion
was found to be at the northern end, where it proved to be
four hundred and seventy-four feet in depth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MAGNIFICENT VIEW</div>

<p>Walking round to the southern end of the crater edge, the
lake, here foreshortened, has a somewhat close resemblance in
outline to that of the lake of Galilee, as seen on maps; but
I must confess that the first sight of it in its deep chasm made
me think much more of the other lake of Palestine, the Dead
Sea, in its profound gorge between the Judean hills and the
highlands of Moab. After making a slight pencil sketch or two,
I proceeded up the far higher saddle-back ridge on the western
side. Here the lake seems much diminished in size and lying
far down at an awful depth. But a magnificent and extensive
view is gained of the surrounding country: the long flat-topped
lines of hill to the east running many miles north and
south, and surmounted directly east by the two perfect cones
of old volcanoes; the peaked and jagged range of Vòlombòrona
to the south-east; the enormous mass of Ibity to the
south, and then west, a flat region broken by abrupt hills.
To the north-west are the thickly populated valleys towards
Bétàfo, with many a cup-shaped hill and mountain marking
old volcanic vents; and beyond this a high mass of country
with serrated outline against the sky, showing the district of
Vàvavàto; and finally, coming to due north, is the varied
grouping of the hills, which form the southern termination of
the central mountain mass of Ankàratra. Between us and
these again is the extensive plain of Antsìrabé, with the white
walls and gables of the church and the mission buildings plainly
visible in the bright sunhsine, although ten or twelve miles
distant—altogether, a panorama long to be remembered.
From this point also the significance and appropriateness of the
name given to the old volcano is clearly seen; for Trìtrìva is
apparently a combination of the words <em>trìtry</em>, a word used to
describe the ridge on the back of a chameleon or a fish, and
<em>ìva</em>, low, deep; so that the name very happily describes the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
long steep western ridge or crater wall, and the deep chasm
sweeping down from it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE VOLCANIC DISCHARGE</div>

<p>It may just be said further, that the slopes of the crater both
inside and out are covered with turf, which grows on a dark
brown volcanic soil, mingled with rounded pebbles of greenish
or purple lava, very compact and close in structure, and containing
minute crystals scattered sparingly through it. Occasional
blocks of this are found round the edge of the crater
wall, and the same rock crops out at many places on the steep
inner slopes. I did not notice any vesicular lava or scoria;
and at a little homestead not far from the north-eastern foot of
Trìtrìva, I was surprised to find the <em>hàdy</em> or fosse dug to twelve
or fourteen feet deep almost entirely through the red clay or
earth found all through the central regions of the island. The
dark brown volcanic soil, here seen in section, appeared to be
only eighteen inches deep, with layers of small pebbles. So
that the discharge of the volcanic dust and ash appears to have
extended only a short distance from the mountain; at least it
does not appear to have been very deep, unless, indeed, there
has been much denudation. It must be remembered, however,
that this point is to the windward side of the hill; probably
the volcanic soil is deeper to the west of it. The much
greater height of the western wall of the crater is no doubt
due to the prevailing easterly winds carrying the bulk of the
ejected matter to the west, and piling it up to two or three
times the height of the eastern side. After seeing the amount
of gneiss rock which must have been blown out of the vent, I
expected to have found much greater quantities of it, and in
larger blocks, than the very few and small fragments actually
seen on the outer slopes. The greater portion, however, is
probably covered up under the quantities of volcanic dust and
<em>lapilli</em> which were subsequently ejected.</p>

<p>Trìtrìva, it will be evident from this slight sketch, will
greatly interest those who have a taste for geology and physical
geography; while its peculiar and somewhat awe-striking
beauty makes it equally worthy of a visit from the artist and
the lover of the picturesque. Certainly it became photographed
upon our memory with a distinctness which rendered it a vivid
mental picture for many a day afterwards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VOLCANO OF ANKÀRATRA</div>

<p>Returning northward from Antsìrabé towards the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
of Itàsy, we have to pass to the westward of the great
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">massif</i> of Ankàratra; and the summits of this mountain mass
being the highest points in the centre of the island, a short
space must be devoted to a brief description of it. From the
capital, Ankàratra is the most prominent object in the landscape
to the south-west, rising by easy gradients to about twice
the elevation of the general level of Imèrina, and three or four
points showing distinctly against the sky, although they are
from forty to forty-five miles distant. The highest point is
called Tsiàfajàvona (“that which the mists cannot climb”),
and is eighty-six hundred and thirty-five feet above sea-level.
There is no doubt that the whole mountain is an
ancient volcano, for the rock which has been poured out as
lava from it is a black olivine basalt. One peak, to the east,
consists of mica-trachyte; and at its northern foot there is an
exposure of augite-andesite rock. “Seen from Antanànarìvo,
the mountain of Ankàratra seems to be one almost uniform
mass, but when actually there, it resolves itself into deep
ravines, enormous spurs, conspicuous peaks, and isolated or
continuous mountain masses. The spurs, which run out like
so many fingers in all directions, and to great lengths from
the main body of the mountain, do not represent so many
lava flows, but have been formed by the numerous streams
which have excavated the deep and wide valleys between
them.”</p>

<p>The amount of lava that has issued from Ankàratra, says
Mr Baron, is truly astounding, reaching in places to a depth
of twelve hundred to fourteen hundred feet, and occasionally
to as much as two thousand feet. Occasionally the basalt
assumes a columnar form; but everywhere the surface of the
lava is decomposed into soil. This, and the apparent absence of
all craters on and around the mountain, seems to point to a
long period having elapsed since the volcano was active, probably
several centuries. When on the highest point of the mountain,
there appear to be two ranges of summits; which lie in
the form of a cross, the intersection being marked by a small
cone. On the south-western slopes are considerable remains
of forest, which probably in former times covered a large proportion
of the present bare highland of the interior of Madagascar.
It is by no means easy to get natives to go with one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
to these lofty points. They are afraid of the vengeance of the
spirits of the mountains, who will punish all who dare invade
their territories.</p>

<p>In one of the valleys to the west of the Ankàratra <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">massif</i>
there is a river called Antsèsika, which is quite lost to sight
and sound for about a mile and a quarter. It disappears under
a mass of enormous gneiss boulders, which have filled up the
valley of the river, so that the stream runs for a considerable
distance at an immense depth below the general level. In the
upper part of its course, this river passes over a series of grand
falls before diving deep into the earth, as just described. Its
name of Antsèsika is very appropriate, as it means “that
which is thrust in.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXTINCT LEMUROID ANIMALS</div>

<p>Some members of the extinct fauna of Madagascar (Æpyornis,
hippopotamus and crocodile) have been already noticed,
but we must here mention other discoveries made within the
last few years. About twenty years ago a skull, in a sub-fossil
condition, was discovered on the south-west of the island, and
proved to be that of a gigantic form of lemuroid animal. This
skull is very much larger and longer than those of any existing
lemurs (which are fairly globular in shape), and belonged to a
creature more like a gorilla in size and strength. More recently,
at a place called Ampàsambazìmba, which is five miles north of
Itàsy, the remains of a number of species (fourteen or fifteen)
of extinct lemuroid animals have been discovered; in fact
this spot seems like the burial-ground of a whole fauna now
entirely passed away, and probably quite recently; for Dr
Standing, who conducted the excavations, thinks that not
more than five centuries have elapsed since some at least of
these animals were living. Several new species of apparently
quite distinct genera have been disinterred; they are mostly
larger than any existing lemuroid; and some of them form
links between the true monkeys and the lemurs—families of
primates now very distinct from each other. Some of these
newly discovered creatures seem, from the position of the
nostrils, eyes and ears (like those of the hippopotamus), to have
been adapted to a partially aquatic life. There is abundant
evidence of the former existence of extensive lakes in the surrounding
country, where now there is only marsh or dry land.
Others of these extinct animals were arboreal; and from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
remains of leaves and branches, together with bones, not to
mention other evidence, there is no doubt that much of what
is now open down and bare hill was formerly covered with
forest. There was therefore appropriate habitat for them all;
and their needs, whether in water or on the trees, would be
met by the former conditions of the country. It seems highly
probable that the physical changes of the interior have been the
chief cause of the extinction of so many living creatures, although
the advent of man upon the scene may have hastened
the process.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PHYSICAL CHANGES</div>

<p>As this chapter necessarily touches less on popular and more
on scientific matters than the rest of this book, a few more
words may be added on the palæontology and geology of
Madagascar. Besides those extinct creatures already spoken
of, remains of gigantic tortoises have been discovered; also
species of swine and river-hog; an ox differing from the existing
cattle of the country, and a large rail and a goose exceeding in
size any living species. All these belonged to the Quaternary
and Recent geological epochs. But far back in the period
of the Secondary rocks a species of sloth lived in the forests,
old forms of crocodile lived in the rivers; and there were three
at least of those gigantic lizards which were the largest of all
known land animals, and were the master existences of the
Jurassic period.</p>

<p>To sum up in a sentence or two the salient features of Madagascar
geology, it may be said that the whole eastern part of the
island from north to south, comprising probably about three-fifths
of the entire area, is composed of crystalline rocks—gneiss,
granite, mica-schist, etc. But the western two-fifths of its
surface consists chiefly of Secondary strata, including chalk
and sandstones and limestones of the Jurassic and Cretaceous,
periods, as well as a smaller area of rocks of the Eocene and
Oligocene eras. A fringe of Quaternary deposits is also found
along a great part of the west coast. It is evident, therefore,
that the western side of the island has been repeatedly under
the sea during the geological periods just mentioned, leaving the
upper highland of ancient rocks as an island not half the extent
of the present Madagascar. It has quite recently been found
that a narrow edging of chalk rock extends for about one hundred
and twenty miles on the central part of the east coast.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
Plutonic rocks are found in several places in both the great
geological divisions of the island, and also many outflows of
volcanic rocks, of a much more recent date.</p>

<p>We have already spoken of the two principal groups of
extinct craters which exist in the central portion of Madagascar.
In the more southerly of these groups, Dr Mullens speaks of an
ascent of Ivòko, one of the finest old volcanoes, which is eleven
hundred and thirty feet high. This, he says, “was a vast
crater, a quarter of a mile across; the encircling wall was
complete except at the south, where the opening was fifty feet
wide. Beneath us, half-a-mile to the east, was another crater,
Iatsìfitra, second only to Ivòko, with its opening to the north.
On the north-west shoulder of Ivòko were two other large
craters, overhanging the village of Bétàfo, two more were
close by to the north-east, and others were conspicuous ten
miles to the north. On the south again were several others,
the horseshoe shape being very marked in them all. Descending
to the crater of Iatsìfitra, we observed that the lava rocks
which had issued from it were black, sharp and fresh, as if they
had been broken yesterday. On the plain I counted thirty
greater piles of lava, like ruined fortresses, and numberless
smaller ones. It was clear that like the Phlegræan fields in
Italy, the entire plain had at some time been on fire; and that
a hundred jets of flame and molten lava had spurted from its
surface, hurling their blazing rockets into the sky. Altogether,
in our journey to the west and south-west of the capital, we
counted a hundred extinct craters, extending over an arc of
ninety miles.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A VOLCANIC BELT</div>

<p>Madagascar appears, therefore, to be the extinct central
portion of a volcanic belt which extends from Great Comoro
to the north-west, through the other islands of the group,
Nòsibé and northern and central Madagascar, to Réunion to
the east, a distance of thirteen hundred and sixty miles. And
it is noteworthy that at each extremity of this belt there is a
still active volcano—viz. Piton de Fournaise, in Réunion, and
one eighty-five hundred feet high in Great Comoro.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EARTHQUAKES</div>

<p>As a country showing numerous traces of volcanic disturbance,
Madagascar is almost every year visited by shocks of
earthquake. Happily these are not of a severe character,
and little damage is usually done; although often a strange<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
subterranean roar accompanies them and a tremor of several
seconds’ duration. The Malagasy still remember a rather severe
earthquake which happened many years ago and detached a
large mass of rock from the cliffs on the precipitous west side
of the ridge on which Antanànarìvo is built. In September
1879 a severe shock, felt most in the Vònizòngo district, was
experienced, and lasted for at least thirty seconds; this was
accompanied by a loud rumbling sound, as of violent thunder,
and in places the ground was split up by the shaking. In the
year 1897, again, slight shocks were very numerous, and on
some days and nights the earth appeared to have been in a
constant state of tremor. These earth movements were felt
more especially in the region of old volcanic disturbance about
Lake Itàsy, where hundreds of slight shocks were experienced
during seven or eight months. On the night of 2nd November
four or five sharp movements occurred, one of which was more
violent than anything remembered by the Malagasy, and
wakened the whole population of the capital and around it in
alarm. Chimney-stacks were thrown down, walls were cracked
and ceilings damaged. This earthquake appears to have been
felt over a very wide extent of country, from Tamatave and
the east coast to Mèvatanàna away north-west, and as far as
the Bétsiléo province in the south. It had the effect of stopping
temporarily the mineral spring at Antsìrabé, which is so exactly
like Vichy water; although, curiously enough, the hot-water
springs, within a few yards of the other, were not affected. In
the Ifànja marsh, a few miles from Itàsy, a small mud geyser
is said to have appeared.</p>

<p>I will conclude this chapter, in which much has been said of
extinct forms of existence, by a glimpse at the ancient animal
life of the island. Let us try to sum up these in a few sentences.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GLIMPSES OF THE PAST</div>

<p>It seems probable that Madagascar, when the first representatives
of mankind occupied it, was a country much more fully
covered by lakes and marshes, and also by forest, than it is at
present. In these waters, amid vast cane-brakes and swamps of
papyrus and sedge, wallowed and snorted herds of hippopotami;
huge tortoises crawled over the low lands on their margins;
tall ostrich-like birds, some over ten feet high, and others no
larger than bustards, stalked over the marshy valleys; great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
rails hooted and croaked among the reeds, and clouds of large
geese and other water-fowl flew screaming over the lakes;
on the sand-banks crocodiles lay by scores basking in the sun;
great ape-like lemurs climbed the trees and caught the birds;
troops of river-hogs swam the streams and dug up roots among
the woods; and herds of slender-legged zebu-oxen grazed
on the open downs. These were the animals which the first
wild men hunted with their palm-bark spears, and shot with
their arrows tipped with burnt clay or stone.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>And as we look further back through long-past geological
ages, when the clays and sandstones of the oolite, and the
white masses of the chalk were being deposited in the coral-studded
tropic seas and archipelagoes of Europe and other
parts of the world, and when Madagascar was probably no
island, but a peninsula of Eastern Africa, the mist opens for a
moment, and we see vast reptile forms dimly through the haze;
great slender-snouted gavials in the streams and lakes, sloths
moving slowly along the branches of the trees, and huge
dinosaurs, sixty to eighty feet long, crawling over the
wooded plains, and tearing down whole trees with their
powerful arms.</p>

<p>Such are some glimpses of the Madagascar of the past which
the study of its rocks and fossils already opens to the mental
eye. We may confidently look for further light upon the dim
and distant bygone ages as we learn more of the geology of the
country. The thick curtain which at present shrouds the old-world
times will be yet more fully lifted, and we shall probably,
ere many more years have passed, be able to draw many more
mental pictures of the extinct animal life of the great African
island.</p>

<br />
<span class="fs70">SOUTHWARDS TO BÉTSILÉO AND THE SOUTH-EAST COAST</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">A FEW years ago I was invited by the Friends’ Foreign
Missionary Association to accompany one of their
missionaries, Mr Louis Street, on a journey to some
of the southern portions of Madagascar. The object of this
journey was twofold: firstly, to visit the scattered Christian
congregations connected with the London Missionary Society,
and to preach to and teach the people; and secondly, to gain
some more accurate information as to the geography and
physical features of the south-eastern provinces, and the
dialects and customs of the different tribes inhabiting those
parts of the great island. At that period (in the seventies)
Madagascar was still unmapped and only very partially
explored. A very large proportion of the country was still
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra incognita</i>; so that missionary journeys away from the
neighbourhood of the capital had all the charm of novelty
and exploration. Its physical geography, its geology, and its
botany and natural history were all practically unknown; so
I looked forward with intense interest to seeing new provinces
and new people; nor was I disappointed in this expectation.</p>

<p>Like all journeys in Madagascar until about twelve years ago,
this one was made by the native conveyance, the <em>filanjàna</em> or
light palanquin (see <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapters II.</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_III">III.</a>), and also, as will be
seen, by frequent voyages in canoes. And although <em>filanjàna</em>
travelling, like all sublunary things, had its drawbacks, I
always enjoyed that mode of getting over the ground. But in
setting off on a journey which was to last for several weeks, it
was not always easy to get started. You might engage your
men for two or three weeks beforehand; you might advance
money to keep a hold on them; you might even induce them
to deposit a small sum with you as security; but one was
never quite sure that every man had arrived, and was going
along with you, until one had got clear away at least half-a-day’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
journey. All sorts of excuses would be made, or no
reason at all be given, especially if the journey was to be
through a part of the island not often traversed. The bearers
were easily hired, but not so easily <em>secured</em>. One man not turning
up, another would go to seek for him, and he, in turn,
would have to be hunted for by his companions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRAVELLING IN MADAGASCAR</div>

<p>Travelling in Madagascar, at least by the main lines of road,
is fast losing its former characteristics. Along the easy gradients,
the bridged streams, and the embankment-crossed swamps
traversed now by good highroads, one is apt to forget how our
bearers used to climb up steep and rugged ascents, ford rivers,
sometimes up to their necks in rushing waters, and flounder
through morasses. In fact, the bearers are becoming somewhat
demoralised by these easy and smooth roads, and we now need
to take a ride “across country” to realise what our early experiences
here were.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Mr Street and I, however, managed to
get a number of men, about fifty in all, to start with us; and
as we were not at all sure of finding native huts to stay in all
through our route, we took a tent with us, as well as provisions
and clothes, and books to give away to the people who could
read them. Towards the end of May we left the capital for
our southern journey.</p>

<p>One more word of preface to this chapter. Like the tour
around the Antsihànaka province, already described, this
journey was, first of all, a missionary one; and although I shall
not trouble my readers with details of this kind, it must be
understood that my companions and I took every opportunity
we had of speaking, not only to congregations, but also to any
small gathering of people we came across, of the great and glad
truths of the Gospel, of which we were the messengers.</p>

<p>I shall not describe here the route between Antanànarìvo and
Fianàrantsòa: the elevated tract of bare table-land, more than
six thousand feet above the sea; the cultivated valleys of the
three or four chief rivers; the green pleasant basins <ins class="corr" id="tn-229" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'of Ambòsita'">
of Ambòsitra</ins> and Ambòhinàmboàrina; the enormous rocks of Angàvo,
and the belt of grey-lichened forest above Nàndihìzana. There
were, however, three points which struck me in the Bétsiléo province
as being very different from what we see in Imèrina. First,
was the much bolder and grander scenery; the mountains are
higher in the south, and the gneiss and granite rocks rise up in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
stupendous masses of stone, such as we do not often see in the
northern province.</p>

<p>Then there was the elaborate system of rice cultivation, far
surpassing anything that can be seen in Imèrina. This was
noticeable after four days’ journey, but it appeared to be carried
to the highest point of perfection in the wide valley south of
Ambòsitra. Not only are the valleys and hollows terraced, as
in Imèrina—the <em>concave</em> portions of the low hills and lower
slopes of the high hills—but the <em>convex</em> portions also are stepped
up like a gigantic staircase for a great height. It was a pleasant
sight to see, speaking of industry and skill and practical knowledge
of hydrostatics; for how water could be brought to some
of the lower elevations surrounded by lower ground was more
than we could discover. Many of these were terraced up to
their highest point, the narrow lines of rice-plot running round
them in concentric circles, so that there was not a square yard
of ground left unproductive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORNAMENTAL TOMBS</div>

<p>The third particular in which the Bétsiléo country differs—although
the <em>past</em> tense would be now more appropriate—from
Imèrina is in the variety and ornamental character of the tombs
and other memorials of the dead. Leaving out of consideration
the modern stone tombs erected in the vicinity of the capital, it
is a remarkable fact that there is no native Hova style of carving
or ornamentation. Neither in their dwellings nor their tombs,
neither in their household utensils nor their weapons, does there
ever seem to have existed among the natives of Imèrina anything
like indigenous art. But in Bétsiléo there is carving both in the
houses and the tombs; the central posts of the former are
elaborately ornamented, and also portions of the exterior woodwork;
and the curious massive timber posts, with framework
for holding the skulls and horns of bullocks killed at funerals,
have a variety of decoration which is well worthy of study.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="p2301_ill1" style="max-width: 50em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bétsiléo Tombs with the Horns of Oxen Killed at the Funeral</span></div>
</div>

<p>The first thing that attracted my attention in travelling south,
after four or five days’ journey, was that the upright stones
placed near graves were not the rough undressed slabs common
in Imèrina, but were finely dressed and squared and ornamented
with carving. Coming after that to Ambòsitra, I first met with
one of the memorial posts just mentioned. This was a piece of
timber, seven or eight inches square and about ten feet high,
with pieces of wood projecting from a little below the top, so as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
to form a kind of stage. Each face of the post was elaborately
carved with different patterns arranged in squares. Some of
these were concentric circles, a large one in the centre, with
smaller ones filling up the angles; others had a circle with a
number of little bosses on them; others had a kind of leaf
ornament, and in others parallel lines were arranged in different
directions. The narrow spaces dividing these squares from each
other had in some cases an ornament like the Norman cheiron,
and in others, something similar to the Greek wave-like scroll.
The whole erection with its ornamentation bore a strong
resemblance to the old runic stones, or the manorial crosses of
Ireland and the Scottish highlands.</p>

<p>A day or two’s journey farther south brought us to a tract
of country where there was a profusion of carved memorials
scattered along the roadside, and in all directions visible on
either hand. And on reaching a rounded green hill west of the
road, the old and deserted village of Ikangàra, we saw that there
was a large number of tombs and memorial posts close together,
so we went to inspect them more minutely. Within a short
distance were some forty or fifty tombs, and on further examination
there appeared to be at least half-a-dozen different kinds:</p>

<p>(1) The largest tombs—there were two of them—were of
small flat stones, built in a square of some twenty to twenty-five
feet, and about five feet high. But all around them was a railing
of posts and rails, all elaborately carved with the patterns just
described.</p>

<p>(2) Another kind of tomb was formed by a square stone
structure, about twelve feet each way and four or five feet high,
but on the top was an enclosure of carved posts and lintels about
eight feet high, with a single carved post in the centre.</p>

<p>(3) A third kind of monument was a massive block of granite
about ten feet high, with carved posts at the corners and touching
them, and connected by cross-pieces; on these the skulls
and horns of the bullocks killed at the funeral of the person
commemorated were fixed.</p>

<p>(4) Another kind of memorial was a massive square post of
wood, about twenty feet high and fifteen inches square, carved
on all four sides from top to bottom. There were four or five
of these enormous posts here; and in one case there was a pair
of them, as if to form a kind of gateway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>(5) Still another kind was a great block of dressed granite,
with iron hooping round the top, in which were fixed a dozen or
more pairs of slender <em>iron</em> horns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ELABORATE CARVING</div>

<p>All the way along the road to Ambòhinàmboàrina we came
across different combinations of memorial posts, and of dressed
fine white granite in upright blocks, in many cases arranged in
couples, so that they were very conspicuous all over the
surrounding country. Before leaving the subject of ornamentation
among the Bétsiléo, I may notice that the window shutters
of their houses, the wooden fixed bedstead—looking more like
a cupboard than a sleeping-place—and other portions of the
interior, are (or were) elaborately carved with the patterns
already mentioned and other designs.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>In the early part of June we left the Bétsiléo capital for the
south, intending if possible to make our way through the forest
to the south-east coast, and thence travel to Fort Dauphine, the
southernmost Hova military station. The route south from
Fianàrantsòa is for many miles through a valley between lofty
hills; and there one gradually ascends to a point where the
valley ends, and at a place called Ivàtoàvo (“high rock”) one
gets a most extensive prospect, of a comparatively level plain
stretching away for many miles, and dotted all over with the
green ring-shaped <em>vàla</em> or homesteads of the Bétsiléo. This
plain is surrounded with the grandest and boldest mountains,
many of them rising sheer from the level in many hundred feet
of bare gneiss rock, and in the most picturesque outlines. To
the north-west one lofty spire of rock has a flat-topped head,
much resembling the Pieter Botha mountain in Mauritius. I
was afterwards told that it was formerly obligatory on a young
man wishing to marry a girl from the district that he should
carry his bride on his back to the summit of this rock, and bring
her down again. It appeared as if one might almost as well
attempt to scale a church spire; but probably there are crevices
and hollows which would make such a feat not altogether
impossible.</p>

<p>Our Sunday at a village on the plain was employed in our
usual way, preaching there, and visiting other places. After
speaking at a short service myself, I left my companion at midday
to go to Iàritsèna, a village about five hundred feet above
the level; but it really looked insignificant compared with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
towering rocks beyond it. The grand and varied forms of the
mountains all around this plain filled me with an exultant kind
of delight. To the south were a crowd of mountain-tops, peak
beyond peak, with the greatest variety of outline: one had
the appearance of a colossal truncated spire; another had a
jagged saw-like ridge, another was like a pyramid with huge
steps, and another was like an enormous dome; but the
varieties were endless, and, as I passed along, the combinations
of the giant masses of bare rock changed every minute. Their
summits were never long free from clouds, and the changing
effects of sunlight and cloud shadow could only have been
caught by the rapid use of a camera. The summits of many of
the peaks must be at least three thousand feet above the plain.
These “everlasting hills,” these “strong foundations of the
earth,” recalled passages in the Psalms and the Prophets,
speaking of Him whose “righteousness is like the great mountains.”</p>

<p>At my little village congregation this afternoon, many of the
girls and women wore a circular ornament suspended from their
necks; this was formed of the end of a <em>conus</em> shell ground down
and generally with a red bead in the centre. This kind of
decoration, called <em>félana</em>, is also worn by men among the
Sàkalàva, but on the side of their temples, and by the Bàra
people on the crown of their heads.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PARAKEETS</div>

<p>Until taking this journey I had not seen in any number the
pretty little parakeet of which Madagascar possesses a peculiar
species (<i>Psittacula madagascariensis</i>). But we noticed a large
flock of these birds one day; and their light green plumage,
with whitish breasts and greyish-white heads, render them
rather conspicuous. They go in large flocks, often as many as
a hundred together, and sometimes do considerable damage to
the rice crops. The two sexes of this parakeet show great
affection for each other, the pair sitting close together on their
perch, from which habit they are often called love-birds.</p>

<p>Two species of parrot are among the denizens of the Malagasy
woods almost all over the country. These parrots are both of
sober plumage, one being dark grey in colour, and the other
slaty-black. But they are both intelligent birds, and can easily
be taught to speak a few words and to whistle a tune. Their
long whistling cry, as if going up the gamut, may be frequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
heard in the outskirts of the woods. The grey species (<i>Coracopsis
obscura</i>), which is the larger of the two, is <em>fàdy</em> or sacred
with the chiefs of the Vèzo Sàkalàva, as they say that one of
their ancestors was saved from death by hearing the shrill
piercing cries of a flock of these birds. The black species
(<i>Coracopsis nigra</i>) is about a third less in size. Both kinds are
more terrestrial and less arboreal in their habits than most
parrots, nor do they make much use of their claws to convey
food to the mouth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN AWKWARD CROSSING</div>

<p>The following day, passing over a river close by Ambòhimandròso,
we had a most awkward bridge to cross. The native
engineer had made it in two spans, not, however, in a straight
line, but forming almost a right angle with each other. There
were two or three massive balks of timber; but as these were
not on a level, and some had slipped down three or four feet,
the passage over was neither easy nor pleasant. Many of our
bearers hesitated a good deal, as the bridge was sixteen to
eighteen feet above the water, which roared like a mill-race
between the rough pier and the river banks.</p>

<p>All about this neighbourhood we noticed great numbers of
ant-hills, of a much larger size than any we had seen elsewhere.
They are conical mounds of a yard or so high, and are made by
a white or yellowish ant, the one spoken of in a well-known Malagasy
nursery tale. Breaking off a piece of one of the mounds,
the ants could be seen in a state of great excitement, running
in and out of the circular galleries which traverse their city.
There are vast numbers of these ants in one ant-hill; they have
a queen, who is nearly an inch long, while her subjects are not
half that size. A serpent is said to live in many of these ant-nests,
and the people maintain that it is eventually eaten by the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Between the point we had now reached and the sea is a great
wooded and rounded mountain which we could see about
twenty miles away, and which we found was the celebrated
Ambòndrombé, the Malagasy Hades, in which they believed
that the souls of their ancestors had their abode. There are
said to be large caves in the mountain, and it is regarded with
much superstitious fear by the people. The mountain looked
dark and gloomy, and has a very regularly curved outline from
north to south, looking like the segment of an immense circle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">“BOUND BY BLOOD”</div>

<p>About twenty miles to the east of our route, although perfectly
hidden by the intervening rugged country and lines of
forest-covered hills, is a very strongly defended Tanàla town
called Ikòngo, a place which maintained its independence of
Hova domination until the French conquest. With considerable
difficulty and some personal risk, my friend, Mr G. A.
Shaw, managed to gain permission to visit this stronghold and
introduce Christian teaching. The native chief, who became
very friendly, wished to become closely allied to him by the
custom of <em>fàto-drà</em>, or <em>fàti-drà</em>. This is a curious ceremony, in
use among many Malagasy peoples, by which persons of different
tribes or nationalities become bound to one another in the
closest possible fashion. The name for it of <em>fàto-drà</em>—<em>i.e.</em>
“bound by blood”—denotes that its object is to make those
entering into the covenant to become as brothers, devoted to
each other’s welfare, and ready to make any sacrifice for the
other, since they thus become of one blood.</p>

<p>The ceremony consists in taking a small quantity of blood
from the breast or side of each contracting party; this is mixed
with other ingredients, stirred up with a spear-point, and then
a little of the strange mixture is swallowed by each of them.
Imprecations are uttered against those who shall be guilty of
violating the solemn engagement thus entered into. A few
Europeans, who have overcome their natural disgust to the
ceremonial, and to whom it has been a matter of great importance
to keep on good terms with some powerful chief, have
occasionally consented to make this covenant. Thus the
celebrated French scientist, M. Alfred Grandidier, became a
brother by blood with Zomèna, a chief of the south-western
Tanòsy, in order to gain his good will and help in proceeding
farther into the interior. But in his case the blood was not
taken from the contracting parties, but from an ox sacrificed
for the purpose; the ceremony is then called <em>famaké</em>. In this
case, a pinch of salt, a little soot, a leaden ball, and a gold bead
were put into the blood, which was mixed with water. Sometimes
pulverised flint, earth and gunpowder are added to the
mixture. In the case of Count Benyowski, who in 1770 was
made king of a large tribe on the eastern coast, he and the
principal chiefs sucked a little blood from each others’ breasts.
The Hova formerly followed a similar custom, but with some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
variations; and so lately as 1897 a high French official made
a somewhat similar covenant, with a principal chief in the
extreme south of the island. The <em>fàto-drà</em> has doubtless been
observed by the various tribes in all parts of Madagascar, but
there appears to have been a good deal of difference in the
details of the ceremonial attending it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BÉTSILÉO HOUSES</div>

<p>We spent a day at Imàhazòny, the last Hova military post
in this direction, before plunging into the unknown route
across the forest to the coast. The people from the little <em>vàla</em>
(homesteads) came running out to see us as we went by, most
of them having never seen a white face before. We noticed
how different the Bétsiléo dialect is from the Hova form of
Malagasy; the <em>n</em> in the latter is always nasal (<em>ng</em>) in the former;
while numerous words are shorter than their equivalents as
spoken in Imèrina; and the consonantal changes are numerous.
Besides this, the vocabulary is very different for many things
and actions. About two hours’ ride on the following morning
brought us to the large village of Ivàlokiànja. We went into
a house, the best in the village, for our lunch; it was the largest
there, but was not so large as our tent (eleven feet square), and
the walls were not six feet high. The door was a small square
aperture, one foot ten inches wide by two feet four inches
high, and its threshold two feet nine inches from the ground;
so that getting into most Bétsiléo houses is quite a gymnastic
feat, and it is difficult to understand how people could put
themselves to so much needless inconvenience. Close to it, at
the end of the house, was another door, or window (it was
difficult to say which, as they are all pretty much the same
size!), and opposite were two small openings about a foot and
a half square. The hearth was opposite the door, and the fixed
bedstead was in what is the window corner (north-west) in
Hova houses. In this house was the first example I had
seen of decorative carving in Malagasy houses; the external
faces of the main posts being carved with a simple but effective
ornament of squares and diagonals. There was also other
ornamentation, much resembling the English Union Jack. The
gables were filled in with a neat plaited work of split bamboo.
The majority of the houses in this and most of the Bétsiléo
villages are only about ten or twelve feet long by eight or nine
feet wide, and the walls from three to five feet high. Hereabouts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
the doors seem generally to face the north or north-west,
and the house runs nearly east and west. Hova houses of the
old style, on the contrary, are always placed with their length
running north and south, and their single door and window
facing the west—that is, on the lee-side of the house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN UNPLEASANT RIDE</div>

<p>As Ambinàny, the Tanàla<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> chief, whose village we were
bound for, did not make his appearance, we went off in the
afternoon to another village, Iòlomàka, about three or four
miles away to the south-east. It was a cold unpleasant ride
in the drizzling rain. We reached the village, which is situated
on a bare hill, in an hour and a quarter, and with some difficulty
found a tolerably level place on which to pitch the tent, but
everything was wet. The rain came down faster than ever,
and began to come through the canvas in some places. During
the afternoon we in our tent formed for the villagers a free,
and evidently popular, exhibition, which might have been entitled,
“The Travelling Foreigners in their Tent.” We and
our belongings, and our most trivial actions, were the subject
of intensest interest to the people. They came peeping in and,
uninvited, took their seats to gaze. I suspect they thought
we travelled in a style of Oriental magnificence, for my companion’s
gorgeous striped rug evidently struck them as being
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne plus ultra</i> of earthly grandeur. But <em>we</em> did not look
upon ourselves this evening quite in that light; for the slightly
higher ground on two sides of the tent led the water <em>into</em> the
structure, and there was soon a respectable-sized pool on my
friend’s side of the tent, above which the boxes had to be raised
by stones and tent-hammers; while the drip upon our beds
raised the probability that we might be able to take our
baths in the morning before getting up. It was our dampest
experience hitherto of tent life.</p>

<p>The following evening found us at Ivòhitròsa, after one of the
most difficult and fatiguing journeys we had ever taken in
Madagascar. It was quite dark when we arrived here, wet,
weary, muddy and hungry, having eaten no food since the
morning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INTERESTED PUBLIC</div>

<p>But to begin at the beginning. Bed was so much the most
comfortable place, with a wet tent, a small pond at one end of
it, and a mass of mud at the other, that we did not turn out
so early or so willingly as usual, especially as there was a thick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
mist and heavy drizzle, as there had been all night. The general
public outside, however, evidently thought it high time the
exhibition opened for a morning performance; and so, without
our intending it, there <em>was</em> a performance, which, if there
had been a daily paper at Iòlomàka, might have been described
as consisting of five acts or scenes, as follows:—<em>Scene first</em>:
Distinguished foreigners are seen lying in bed, so comfortably
tucked up that they feel most unwilling to get out on to the
wet and muddy floor. Curtains only half drawn (by an eager
public) during this act. <em>Scene second</em>: Somewhat of a misnomer,
as D. F. were, by the exercise of some ingenuity, <em>not</em>
seen during the operations of bathing and washing. <em>Scene
third</em>: D. F. seen by admiring public—who again admitted
themselves—in the act of brushing their hair and performing
their toilet. <em>Scene fourth</em>: D. F. seen at their breakfast; the
variety of their food, dishes, plates, etc., a subject of mute
amazement. <em>Scene fifth and last</em>: D. F. seen rapidly packing
up all their property for their approaching departure. <em>N.B.</em>—Probably
their last appearance on this stage. We packed up
in the heavy drizzle, and fortunately, just as we were about
to start, three or four Tanàla came up and agreed to be our
guides. We had to wait until they had their rice, but at last
we got away, soon after ten o’clock, rather too late as it turned
out.</p>

<p>Our way for more than two hours was through the outskirts
of the forest: a succession of low hills partially covered with
wood, and divided from each other by swampy valleys. In
these we had two or three times to cross deepish streams by
bridges of a single round pole, a foot or two <em>under</em> water, a
ticklish proceeding, which all our luggage bearers did not accomplish
successfully. After crossing a stream by the primitive
bridge of a tree which had fallen half over the water, we
entered the real forest, our general direction being to the
south-east.</p>

<p>And now for an hour and a half we had to pass through dense
forest by a narrow footpath, where no <em>filanjàna</em> (palanquin)
could be carried (at least with its owner seated on it). Up and
down, down and up, stooping under fallen trees, or climbing
over them, soon getting wet through with the dripping leaves on
either hand, and the mud and water underfoot—we had little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
time to observe anything around us, lest a tree root or a slippery
place should trip us up. At two-fifteen we came to an open
clearing, and thought our difficulties were over, but presently
we plunged into denser forest than ever, and up and down
rougher paths. Notwithstanding the danger of looking about,
it was impossible to avoid admiring the luxuriance of the
vegetation. Many of the trees were enormously high, and so
buttressed round their trunks that they were of great girth at
the ground. The tree-ferns seemed especially large, with an
unusual number of fronds; and the creeper bamboo festooned
the large trees with its delicate pinnate leaves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DEEP GORGE</div>

<p>It soon became evident that we were descending, and that
pretty rapidly. For a considerable distance we had a stream
on our left hand, which roared and foamed over a succession
of rapids, going to the south-east; and every now and then we
caught glimpses of the opening in the woods made by the
stream, presenting lovely bits of forest scenery in real tropical
luxuriance. The sun shone out for a few minutes, but presently
it clouded over, and heavy rain came on. The increasing
roar of waters told of an unusually large fall, and in a few
minutes we came down an opening where we could see the greater
part of it, a large body of water rushing down a smooth slope
of rock about a hundred feet deep, and at an angle of forty-five
degrees. Three or four times we had to cross the stream, on
rocks in and out of the water, with a powerful current sweeping
around and over them. We found after a while that we had
come down to the side of a deep gorge in the hills which rose
hundreds of feet on each side of it, and down which the stream
descended rapidly by a series of grand cascades to the lower
and more open country which we could see at intervals through
openings in the woods.</p>

<p>At half-past four we emerged from the forest and came down
by a steep slippery path through bush and jungle. And now
there opened before us one of the grandest scenes that can be
imagined. The valley, down which we had come, opened out
into a tremendous hollow or bay, three or four miles across, and
more than twice as long, running into the higher level of the
country from which we had descended. The hills, or, rather,
edges of the upper plateau, rise steeply all round this great
bay, covered with wood to their summits, which are from two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
thousand to three thousand feet above the lower country. Between
these bold headlands we could count four or five waterfalls,
two of them falling in a long riband of foam several
hundred feet down perpendicular faces of rock. Between the
opening points of this great valley, three or four miles apart,
could be seen a comparatively level undulating country, with
patches of wood and the windings of the river Màtitànana. On
a green hill to the north side of the valley was a group of houses,
which we were glad to hear was Ivòhitròsa, our destination.
This hill we found was seven hundred feet above the stream at
its foot, but it looked small compared with the towering heights
around it. At last we reached the bottom of the valley, crossed
the stream, and presently commenced the steep ascent to the
village. It was quite dark before we reached it, muddy, wet
and tired out; we had been eight hours on the way, and five
and a half on foot over extremely rough and fatiguing paths.
The native chief and his people had overtaken us in the forest
and went on first to prepare a house for us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A STRIKING PICTURE</div>

<p>We found that the best dwelling in the village was ready, and
a bright fire blazing on the hearth. It was with some difficulty
that we got all our baggage arranged inside, for, although the
largest house available, it was rather smaller than our tent,
and nearly a quarter of it was occupied by the hearth and the
space around it. At one side of the fire were sitting four young
women, the daughters of the chief. A glance at these young
ladies showed us that we had come into the territory of a tribe
different from any we had yet seen. They were lightly clothed
in a fine mat wrapped round their waists, but were highly ornamented
on their heads, necks, and arms. A fillet of small white
beads, an inch or so wide, was round their heads, fastened by a
circular metal plate on their foreheads. From their necks hung
several necklaces of long oval white beads and smaller red ones.
On their wrists they had silver rings, and a sort of broad
bracelet of small black, white, and red beads; and on every
finger and on each thumb were rings of brass wire. In the
glancing firelight they certainly made a striking picture of
barbaric ornamentations; and notwithstanding their dark
skins and numerous odd little tails of hair, some of them were
comely enough. We had soon to ask them to retire in order to
stow away our packages and get some tea ready. The house<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
was raised a foot or so from the ground, the inside lined with
mats, and so was a pleasant change from our damp lodgings of
the previous evening.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RICE-HOUSES</div>

<p>Next morning, on opening our window, we had before us, two
or <ins class="corr" id="tn-241" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'tree miles across'">
three miles across</ins> the great basin or valley, three waterfalls,
one descending in a long white line and almost lost in spray
before it reaches the bottom. The sunlight revealed all the
beauties of the scene around us, and made us long for the power
to transfer to canvas or paper its chief outlines. Were such a
neighbourhood as this in an accessible part of any European
country, it would rapidly become famous for its scenery. We
found the village of Ivòhitròsa to consist of twelve houses only,
enclosed within a <em>ròva</em> of pointed stakes; but besides these are
several rice-houses or <em>tràno àmbo</em> (“high houses”) mounted on
posts five or six feet above the ground, each post having a
circular wooden ring just under the flooring rafters, and projecting
eight or nine inches, so as to prevent the rats ascending
and helping themselves to rice. I sincerely wished last night
that the dwelling-houses had a similar arrangement, for the rats
had a most jovial night of it in our lodgings, being doubtless
astonished at the number and variety of the packages just
arrived. The house we are in, as well as others in the village,
has carved horns at the gables, not the crossed straight timbers
so called in Hova houses, but curved like bullocks’ horns. The
people appear to have no slaves here, for the daughters of the
chief, in all their ornaments, are pounding rice, four at one
mortar.</p>

<p>At this part of the island the high interior plateau seems to
descend by <em>one</em> great step to the coast plains, and not by <em>two</em>,
as it does farther north; for our aneroid told us that we came
down twenty-five hundred feet yesterday, and that the stream
at the foot of this hill is only five hundred or six hundred
feet above sea-level. And the two lines of forest one crosses
farther on are here united into one.</p>

<p>The men and many of the women wear a rather high round
skull-cap made of fine plait; the women wear little except a
mat sewn together at the ends, so as to form a kind of sack,
and fastened by a cord round the waist, and only occasionally
pulled up high enough to cover the bosom. Those who are
nursing infants have also a small figured mat about eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
inches square on their backs and suspended by a cord from the
neck; this is called <em>lòndo</em>, and is used to protect the child from
the sun or rain, as it lies in a fold of the mat above the girdle.
Some of the men wear a mat as a <em>làmba</em>, and only a few have
<em>làmbas</em> of coarse <em>rofìa</em> or hemp cloth. The people here blacken
their teeth with a root, which gives them an unpleasant appearance
as they open their mouths; not all the teeth, however,
are thus disfigured, but chiefly those at the back, leaving
the front ones white; in some cases the lower teeth are alternately
black and white.</p>

<p>The morning of one of our four days at Ivòhitròsa was employed
in trying to get a good view of the largest of the waterfalls
which pour down into the large valley already mentioned.
Mounting a spur of the main hills, we had a good view of this
chief fall up a deep gorge to the south, and so opening into the
main valley as not to be visible from the village. This is
certainly a most magnificent fall of water. The valley ends in
a semicircular wall of rock crowned by forest, and over this
pours at one leap the river Màtitànana. Knowing the heights
of some of the neighbouring hills, we judged that the fall could
not be less than from five hundred to six hundred feet in depth,
and from the foot rises a continual cloud of spray, like smoke,
with a roar which reverberates up the rocky sides of the valley;
even from two or three miles’ distance, which was as near as we
could get, it was a very grand sight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MALAGASY RASPBERRIES</div>

<p>While on this little excursion we had a feast of another kind.
On our way home we came across a large cluster of bushes full
of wild raspberries. This fruit is common on the borders of
the forest, but we never before saw it in such quantities, or
of so large a size, or of so sweet a taste. The Malagasy raspberry
is a beautiful scarlet fruit, larger than the European
kind; and while perhaps not quite equal in flavour to those
grown in England, is by no means to be despised; and we were
able on that day to enjoy it to our heart’s content.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Tanàla Girls Singing and Clapping Hands</span></div>
</div>

<p>During our stay at Ivòhitròsa we were surprised and delighted
with the brightness and intelligence of many of the native boys.
Although the dialectic differences of the Tanàla speech are
many as compared with the Hova form of Malagasy, we obtained
a large vocabulary from them as well as names of the
forest birds and animals, and also those of trees and fruits.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
And as these forests and their vicinity are the home of several
of the lemurs which have not yet been noticed in these pages,
I will here give some particulars of four or five species.</p>

<p>The ring-tailed lemur (<i>Lemur catta</i>) is perhaps the best known
of all the lemuridæ, from its handsomely marked tail, which
is ringed with black and white bands, thus clearly distinguishing
it from all the other species of the sub-order. And while
almost every other lemur is arboreal, this species lives among
the rocks, over which they can easily travel, but can be only
followed with great difficulty. The palms of their hands are
long, smooth and leather-like, and so enable these animals to
find a firm footing on the slippery wet rocks. The thumbs on
the hinder hands are very much smaller than those of the forest-inhabiting
lemurs, as they do not need them for grasping
the branches of trees. Their winter food is chiefly the fruit
of the prickly pear; while in summer they subsist chiefly on
wild figs and bananas. This species bears a sea voyage fairly
well, so that they are often seen in Mauritius and Réunion,
and even more distant places.</p>

<p>Another species of lemur, which inhabits the south-eastern
forests, is the broad-nosed gentle lemur (<i>Hapalemur simus</i>).
This animal is found among the bamboos, and it appears to
subsist in a great measure on the young shoots of that plant.
For biting and mincing up the stalks its teeth seem admirably
adapted, as they are nearly all serrated cutting teeth, and are
arranged so as mutually to intersect. It eats almost all the
day long, and has a curious dislike of fruit. It is furnished with
a remarkably broad pad on each of the hinder thumbs, so that
it is able to grasp firmly even the smallest surfaces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUSE-LEMURS</div>

<p>Perhaps the most beautiful and interesting—as well as the
smallest—lemuriæ animals inhabiting Madagascar belong to
the group called Cheirogale, or mouse-lemurs, of which there
are seven species. As their name implies, they are very small,
the dwarf species (<i>Cheirogaleus minor</i>) being only four inches
long, with a tail of six inches. This pretty little animal is
remarkable also for its large and very resplendent eyes, for
the eye admits so much light at dusk that quite an unusual
brilliancy is produced. The brown mouse-lemur (<i><ins class="corr" id="tn-243" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Cheirgaleus major'">
Cheirogaleus major</ins></i>) is larger than the last-named species, being seven or
eight inches long. Most, if not all, of the species live in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
highest trees, and make a globular nest of twigs and leaves;
they all appear to be nocturnal animals, as one might suppose
from the structure of their eyes. The smallest, or dwarf,
species, is said to be very shy and wild, very quarrelsome and
fights very fiercely. Some of these little animals, if not all of
them, have a time of summer sleep; and the tail, which is
grossly fat at the beginning of that period, becomes excessively
thin at its close, its fat being slowly absorbed to maintain
vitality. The two (or three) species of mouse-lemur here noticed
inhabit the south-eastern forest region; others appear to be
confined to the north-western woods.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> A writer in a defunct newspaper, <cite>The Madagascar Times</cite>, of

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> My friend, Mr G. A. Shaw, who was connected for several
years with the Bétsiléo Mission, made a number of “rubbings”

one of the members expressed a strong opinion that these

<span class="fs70">IVÒHITRÒSA</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">OUR Sunday at Ivòhitròsa was such a novel and interesting
one that I shall depart for once from my rule
of omitting in these chapters mention of our religious
work. It was a wet morning, so that it was after eleven o’clock
before the rain ceased and we could call the people together.
A good many had come up from the country round on the previous
day to see us, and we collected them on a long and pretty
level piece of rock which forms one side of the little square
around which the houses are built. When all had assembled,
there must have been nearly three hundred present, including
our own men, who grouped themselves near us. It was certainly
the strangest congregation we had ever addressed, for
the men had their weapons, while the women looked very
heathenish. Some few had put some slight covering over the
upper part of their bodies, but most were just as they ordinarily
appeared, some with hair and necks dripping with castor oil, and
with their conspicuous bead ornaments on head, neck, and arms.
One could not but feel deeply moved to see these poor ignorant
folks, the great majority of them joining for the first time in
Christian worship, and hearing for the first time the news of
salvation. And remembering our own ignorance of much of
their language, the utter strangeness of the message we
brought, and the darkness of their minds, we could not but
feel how little we could in one brief service do to quicken
their apprehension of things spiritual and eternal. We had
some of our most hearty lively hymns and tunes, our men
assisting us well in the singing; after Mr Street had spoken
to the people from a part of the Sermon on the Mount, I
also addressed them, trying in as simple a manner as was
possible to tell them what we had come for, what that “glad
tidings” was which we taught them. On account of the
rain, work in the afternoon had to be confined to what could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
be done in our tent, which was crammed full, and in our
house.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>That there was great need for enlightenment may be seen
from what we heard from the people themselves—viz. that
there are (or were) eight unlucky days in every month, and
that children born on those days were killed by their being
held with their faces immersed in water in the winnowing-fan.
So that on an average, more than a quarter of the children
born were destroyed! The Tanàla names for the months are
all different from those used in Imèrina; they have no names
for the weekdays, and indeed no division of time by sevens,
but the days throughout each month (lunar) are known by
twelve names, some applied to two days and others to three days
consecutively, and these day names are nearly all identical
with the Hova names for the months. Each of the days
throughout the month has its <em>fàdy</em>, or food which must not
be eaten when travelling on that day.</p>

<p>After our four days’ stay at Ivòhitròsa, we managed to get
on our way towards the coast, not, however, without having
considerable difficulty with our bearers, who were afraid of
any new and hitherto untried route, for we were the first
Europeans to travel in this direction. By tact and firmness
we managed to secure our point; and on the Thursday afternoon
we came down to the river Màtitànana, which is at this
point a very fine broad stream, with a rapid and deep current.
It flows here through a nearly straight valley for four or five
miles in a southerly direction, with low bamboo-covered hills
on either side, and its channel much broken by rocky islands.
To cross this stream, about a hundred yards wide at this place,
no canoes were available, but there was a bamboo raft called a
<em>zàhitra</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ZÀHITRA</div>

<p>Of all the rude, primitive and ramshackle contrivances ever
invented for water carriage, commend me to a <em>zàhitra</em>. This
one consisted of about thirty or forty pieces of bamboo, from
ten to twelve feet long, lashed together by bands of some tough
creeper or <em>vàhy</em>, which said bamboos were constantly slipping
out of their places and needed trimming at every trip, and the
fastenings had to be refixed. The <em>zàhitra</em> would take only two
boxes and one man at a trip, besides the captain of the raft,
and when loaded was from a third to a half of it under water.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
The civilisation of the people about here seemed to have not
yet produced a paddle; a split bamboo supplied (very imperfectly)
the place of one. Owing to the strong current and
the feeble navigating appliances available, not more than about
four trips over and back again could be made in an hour. And
so there on the bank we sat from a little after two o’clock until
nearly six, watching the ferrying over of our baggage, and then
of our bearers. At sunset a good number of our men were
still on the wrong side of the water, and so, as there was no
possibility of getting them all over that day, and neither Mr
S. nor I relished the prospect of a voyage on a <em>zàhitra</em> in the dark,
we crossed at a little after sunset. We made a safe passage,
but got considerably wet during its progress; Mr S. took an
involuntary foot-bath, and I a sitz-bath. The rest of our men
returned to a village overlooking the river, while we went a
little way up the woods and, finding a level spot, pitched the
tent there, our bearers who had crossed occupying two or three
woodcutters’ huts which were fortunately close at hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A VILLAGE BELLE</div>

<p>During the three or four hours’ waiting on the river bank we
had a good opportunity of observing the people from the
village just above, who came down to watch our passage over
the water. Amongst them was a girl whose appearance was so
striking that I must attempt a description of her. She was a
comely lassie, although a dark-skinned one, and was so ornamented
as to be conspicuous among her companions even at
some distance. Round her head she had the same fillet of white
beads with a metal plate in the front which we had observed at
Ivòhitròsa, but from it depended a row of small beads like drops.
On each side of her temples hung a long ornament of hair and
beads reaching below her chin, several beads hung from her
ears, and a number of white and oblong beads were worked into
her hair at the back. Round her neck she had six strings of
large beads, and another passing over one shoulder and under
the arm. On each wrist were three or four silver bracelets,
while on every finger and thumb were several coils of brass wire.
Her clothing was a piece of bark cloth fastened just above the
hips, over a skirt of fine mat, and on each toe was a brass ring.
Thus “from top to toe” she was got up regardless of expense;
she was probably the daughter of the chief; anyhow, she was
evidently the village belle, and seemed well aware of the fact.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp63" id="p2481_ill" style="max-width: 37.5em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Tanàla Spearmen</span><br />

Note the wooden shields covered with bullock’s hide, and the charm on a man’s

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>Our route towards the sea was now over a comparatively
level country, but not without many steep ascents and descents,
and generally following the valley of the Màtitànana. As I
took with me a good theodolite, I was able to make a running
survey of a large portion of our journey, and to map, for the
first time, that river valley. The path was often hidden by
long grass which was much higher than our heads, the bearers’
feet being frequently hurt by the sharp prickly grass called
<em>tsèvoka</em>. We had beautiful views of the river, and the foliage
became most luxuriant; the valleys were full of the elegant
traveller’s tree, while in front of us whole hills were covered
with the lovely light green of the bamboo, with its graceful
curving head and fine pinnate leaves at every joint.</p>

<p>A very prominent feature in the vegetation of many places
we passed through was the <em>longòzy</em>, a plant which seemed
frequently to prevent anything else from growing (<i>Amomum
angustifolium</i>). It has a rod-like stem, rising sometimes from
twelve to fourteen feet high, with leaves a foot or more long,
growing alternately on each side the stem. At the base grow
the fruits in a bright, smooth, scarlet husk, two or three inches
long, enclosing a white silky-looking pulp containing a number
of purplish-black seeds, the cardamom of commerce. The pulp
has a pleasant acid taste, but if one of the seeds is broken a
pungent burning sensation is experienced at the back of the
mouth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TANÀLA HOUSES</div>

<p>The better kind of houses in these Tanàla villages have the
walls made of bamboo flattened and plaited together, while the
poorer ones are of the leaves of the traveller’s tree. Every
house is roofed with the latter material; in many of them the
gable projects at the ridge twice as much as at the eaves, so
as to make a kind of pent at each end. The gable timbers are
frequently cut into a very exact resemblance to ox horns. In
most of the villages money seems of little use to the people;
they value beads or calico much more. Every woman and girl,
and many of the men and boys, are decorated with beads, and
these seem an important part of their property. Their religion
seems to consist chiefly of charms; charms against guns,
fever, crocodiles, etc. We purchased for a little cloth a charm
against gun-shot; this consisted of three hollow tin receptacles
resembling crocodiles’ teeth, joined together and filled with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
what looks like coarsely cut tobacco. The former owner tells
us that this charm has such virtue that a musket ball is turned
aside from the fortunate wearer. Many of the people carry
shields, which are made of a circular piece of tough wood, about
eighteen inches in diameter and covered with undressed
bullocks’ hide. A handle is cut out of the solid wood at the
back. The women in this Màtitànana valley carry a broad
knife or chopper stuck in their girdles, and resembling in shape
a butcher’s cleaver, with a short round handle; this is used for
cutting up manioc and other roots.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A JUNGLE OF BAMBOO</div>

<p>At one point on our route we passed through a dense jungle
of bamboo, requiring a bright look-out on the part of the
bearers—and the borne as well—to avoid damage from the
sharp-edged stumps underfoot, and the stems and tendrils overhead.
But the effect of the numberless thickly set, smooth,
jointed stems, like slender columns below, and the feathery
canopy of delicate green above, was both curious and beautiful.
At one little stream we passed some fine specimens of the <em>hòfa</em>,
a screw-pine or pandanus, with the aerial roots in a cone-shaped
mass, rising five or six feet above the ground. A very common
tree about here is one with clusters of large leaves like those of
a horse-chestnut, and with a hard mottled green fruit as big as
a lemon, from which gum is made.</p>

<p>In a small open space among the trees we passed by almost the
only sign we had yet seen of anything like religious observances
in the Tanàla country. This was an upright stake in the
ground with a number of bamboos arranged round it, forming
a cone-shaped erection; in front of this several stones were
fixed. At this rude altar the heads of cattle, fowls, etc., are
thrown as expiatory offerings; and here also the people come
to pray for blessings which they desire, especially for children.
We also passed on another day a long flat stone supported by
several smaller ones, forming a sort of altar, and used for the
same kind of offerings as those just described.</p>

<p>Following in the main the course of the river Màtitànana,
we had frequently to cross its tributaries, and found we were
advancing in civilisation as we proceeded. First, we had a
single <em>zàhitra</em> to ferry us over; then two <em>zàhitra</em> and a small
canoe; then we got good-sized canoes. A little after leaving
the ferry we passed through a large clump of immense banana-trees.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
They were at least forty feet high, and with their smooth
green stems—almost trunks—and grand broad leaves, and
great clusters of fruit, presented a magnificent appearance.
The fruit is called <em>òntsy</em>; these are about a foot long and
a couple of inches thick, and so a single one makes a fair
meal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CROCODILES</div>

<p>For several miles the river makes a great bend to the north,
and on following its banks again we saw crocodiles for the first
time on this journey. These were basking in the sunshine,
perfectly motionless, on a group of rocks just showing above
the water. At the distance we were I should not have noticed
them but for my men pointing them out; but with the glass
every scale could be seen, and very unpleasant-looking creatures
they are in their slimy length, with serrated back and tail, and
rather small heads. Near them were several large wading-birds,
some white and others dark brown, and called <em>àrondòvy</em>
(<em>i.e.</em> “protector of the enemy”). These birds are constant
attendants on the crocodiles, performing some service for them;
and where the birds are seen, the reptiles are never far distant.
We afterwards noticed that near all the villages on the river banks
a small space in the water was enclosed with stakes, so
that the women and children coming to draw water could do so
without fear of being seized by a crocodile, or swept off into the
stream by his tail.</p>

<p>From a remote period the Malagasy have been accustomed
to resort to ordeals for the detection of crime, and the ordeal by
the <em>tangèna</em> poison has already been referred to in these pages
(see <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a>). But among the Tanàla tribes an ordeal
of another kind was commonly employed to find out a guilty
person; for anyone suspected of wrong-doing was taken to the
bank of the Màtitànana, or one of its tributaries, where crocodiles
abound. The people having assembled, a man stood near the
accused, and striking the water thrice, addressed a long speech
to the reptiles, adjuring them to punish the guilty, but to spare
the innocent. The accused was then made to swim across the
river and back again; and if he successfully accomplished this,
and was not hurt by the crocodiles, he was considered innocent,
and his accuser was fined four oxen. If, on the contrary, he was
seized and killed, he was supposed to have justly merited his
fate. This ordeal was termed <em>tangèm-voày</em> (<em>voày</em> = crocodile).</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">HAIRDRESSING</div>

<p>As we proceeded nearer the coast, we found by the style of
hairdressing among the women that we had come into the
territory of a different tribe to that amongst whom we had been
travelling. Many of the young women had a singular but somewhat
elegant style of coiffure. It was done thus: the hair was
plaited in very fine braids, and then twisted into thin flat
circular coils of from two to two and a half inches in diameter;
these were symmetrically arranged, one overlapping the other,
in two rows, the upper one completely encircling the head from
the forehead to the back of the neck, and the other ending
below the ears. These young girls really looked well, for they
had the appearance of being well dressed. The women here
were more fully clothed than those of the Tanàla; the skirt of
fine mat is worn here, but there is more of it, and hemp cloth
seems in more common use.</p>

<p>The country became flatter, undulating, but with no prominent
rising grounds. The vegetation also was quite different from
what we had become accustomed to during the last four days.
There were no more bamboos, hardly any traveller’s trees, but
large numbers of single trees or small clumps of them. These
were chiefly the <em>adàbo</em>, a species of <em>Ficus</em>, a tree with massive
smooth trunk and light brown bark; they have a much more
rounded and shapely outline than the forest trees, and give the
scenery quite an English appearance. But the presence of an
occasional fan-palm or cocoanut-palm lifting their tall plumes
aloft soon dispelled the illusion. The villages, too, became
numerous, and many of them are built five or six together—that
is, in lines of as many, only a short distance between them.</p>

</div>

<p>We had a curious congregation on the Sunday at one of the
two villages where we spoke to the people, of whom a good many
collected together. But as heavy showers came on, most of our
auditors were standing under the elevated rice-houses (<em>tràno àmbo</em>),
as we also were. Still we were able to speak a few
earnest words to them. Almost in the midst of our speaking,
the old chief of the village came up to give us—a bottle of rum!
and a fowl. The former of these presents, as well as others of the
same kind, were, as soon as darkness set in, carried outside, and
poured on the ground as the best way of disposing of their
contents. We were glad to find that the Taimòro, among whom
we had now come, did not, like the Tanàla, kill children born on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
unlucky days, but by some ceremonies and offerings avert the
evils supposed to be connected with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GREAT ARUMS</div>

<p>A week’s journey from Ivòhitròsa brought us to a Hova
military post again—viz. to the town of Ambòhipèno, which is
only a few miles from the mouth of the Màtitànana river, and
is the central one of a line of three villages. Here we had a
hospitable reception from the governor and his officers, as well
as from the congregation and its pastor. Although the sea was
still some miles distant, we could distinctly hear the roar of the
surf some time before reaching Ambòhipèno. On a voyage to
the seaside, which we made the day after our arrival, we had a
fine large canoe which had more sharply pointed stem and stern
than in those seen in Imèrina. We were struck by the great
arums (<em>vìha</em>) growing in thick masses along the banks in the
water. These were from twelve to fifteen feet high, with thick
fleshy stems and leaf-stalks, lily-like leaves, between two and
three feet long, and magnificent white flowers, with a scarlet
pistil. The fruit is occasionally used by the natives as an article
of food. We picked up some good shells (<i>Turritellæ</i>, <i>Cypræa</i>,
etc.) on the seashore, as well as corals, seaweed and sponges.
Like almost every river on the east coast, the mouth is closed by
a sand bar, until the rains of the wet season fill the river so full
that the bar is broken for a few weeks, and then the south-east
winds and currents close it up again.</p>

<p>The greater part of two days were spent at Ambòhipèno in
services and school examinations, which latter were especially
interesting and satisfactory. We were amused by the decoration
of the pulpit in the native church, which was rather extraordinary.
It was a high box-like affair, part of the front being
occupied by a picture of a European ship, the other part by a
church with a tall tower and spire; while over these was a text
(in Malagasy), “Says the owner of this house, Fear”; although
it would be difficult to find the passage in this exact form.
These objects, together with birds perched on trees, made a
curious mixture of subjects for pulpit decoration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUTTERFLIES</div>

<p>In the narrow lanes near the village we passed great numbers
and many varieties of butterflies in a few minutes’ ride. Judging
from what we saw, an entomologist would find a rich harvest
in the Taimòro country. Dr Vinson, a French naturalist who
came up to the capital in 1862, says: “The habits of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
lepidoptera are much affected in Madagascar by atmospheric
changes. In the misty mornings everything sleeps or hides
itself under the damp foliage, but as soon as the sun shines out,
the forest, the footpath, the beds of the torrents, are peopled
with bright-coloured and light-flying butterflies. They give
themselves up to all kinds of frolic with a wanton joy; they
court, they pursue, they fly, interlacing and eddying in their
flight in the air like the brilliant flakes of a coloured snow.” In
travelling up through this eastern forest a few years later, but
in the hotter season of the year, I was struck by the number and
variety of the butterflies which crossed our path. There was
the rather common one of greyish-green with dark markings,
the blackish-brown one with two large blue spots, the widely
distributed warm brown one with black-edged wings, the pure
white one, the white with orange edges, the white with black
edges, the white with small black spots near the edge of the
wings, the small yellow species, the small buff one, the white
with crimped edges, the minute brown and blue, and many
others. In damp places, a cloud of the smaller yellow and buff
kinds may be often seen sipping the moisture.</p>

<p>While staying near the forest I was several times struck by
the curious formation of the wings of one of the smaller species
of butterfly. The insect in question is of plain inconspicuous
colouring, chiefly shades of brown, and when at rest sits with
the wings erect. The noticeable point is that there are several
strongly marked and dark-tinted processes from the hinder part
of the wings, which resemble the head, eyes and antennæ of a
butterfly, so that when at rest it is very difficult to say which
is the head and which is the tail of the insect. The tail markings
and points are so much more strongly emphasised than the
actual head and antennæ, that it is only when the wings
slightly open that one is undeceived. Mimicry of one insect
by another, and mimicry of leaves, grass, etc., by insects, are of
course well-known facts, but I do not remember to have seen any
similar instances noticed of resemblance between the different
parts of the same insect; but may not the reason of this
mimicry of the head by the tail be of some service in directing
the attention of birds and other enemies to the less vital part
of the butterfly’s structure? It is evident that the hinder
portion of the wings might be snapped at and broken off, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
yet no serious injury be done to the vital parts of the insect.
However this may be, the point appears to me to be worth
noting down as a curious fact.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARAB INFLUENCE</div>

<p>Talking with the people in the evening, we found we were in
one of the districts where the Arab influence must have been
very strong in former times. They are called Zafin Ibrahim
(descendants of Abraham), and told us they were connected
with the Jews. There is no doubt, however, that the Arabs had
anciently an important settlement here, and to some extent
taught the use of Arabic letters and literature; but being
isolated from their fellow-countrymen and co-religionists, they
gradually became absorbed in the native population. It is
probable that many of the chiefs of the south-east tribes are of
Arab descent, and so are often lighter in colour than the mass
of the people. An intelligent young man gave me a paper
containing all the Arabic characters and many of the syllabic
sounds, with their equivalents in Malagasy. He had, about
six years previously, copied out for M. A. Grandidier, who was
then exploring the coasts of Madagascar, a number of extracts
from native Arabic books of prayers, genealogies, and sorcery.
This young man’s father, then dead, was one of the <em>ombiàsy</em> or
diviners, and his books of charms and incantations, being
supposed to be connected with idolatry, were destroyed at the
time of the burning of the idols in 1869. A few years after our
journey, two of the Bétsiléo missionaries, when making an
evangelistic tour among the south-east tribes, obtained some
pages of manuscript from this neighbourhood. These were
apparently written in Arabic; and on being submitted to an
expert in that language, were pronounced to be extracts from
the Koran, evidently copied by someone who did not know
Arabic, and so were full of errors; these quotations were no
doubt used as charms and invocations. (I may here notice
that, very recently, copies of the Malagasy scriptures have been
boiled by the native diviners, and the water sold as a very
powerful charm!)</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEA-BIRDS</div>

<p>Being near the sea, we had opportunities of seeing many birds
which are oceanic in their distribution, among which are the
frigate-birds (one species), and the tropic-birds (two species).
The former are true pirates, living almost in dependence upon
other fishing birds, whom they force, when these are weaker<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
than themselves, to give up the fish they have taken. But
they do also fish for themselves, darting down upon the surface
of the water. The white tropic-bird is also an expert fisher,
plunging sometimes to a great depth after its prey. They
remain all night on their nest, leaving it at sunrise to fish in the
open sea. After heavy storms the frigate-bird is occasionally
seen quite in the interior, being apparently driven inwards by
the violence of the wind.</p>

<p>Of the sea-birds proper, there are about a score kinds frequenting
the coasts of Madagascar, including those widely
spread and powerful-winged species belonging to the terns, the
noddies, the gulls, and the petrels. Very little, however, has
been noted here as to their habits, and they probably differ
little, if anything, from their fellows which are found all over
the world. One of the terns comes up into the interior, and
has been shot in Imèrina, and so also has one of the gulls;
another is common on the Alaotra lake in Antsihànaka.</p>


<div class="footnote">

are becoming enlightened and Christianised.</p>

<br />
<span class="fs70">AMONG THE SOUTH-EASTERN PEOPLES</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">FROM the Hova military post at Ambòhipèno, my
companion and I made our way southwards, or rather
first to the south-west, intending to visit the congregations
at the three or four other important places in this district,
as well as some of those in their vicinity. This part of Madagascar
is a comparatively level or undulating country, extending
for many miles between the forest-covered mountains and
highlands to the west, and the ocean to the east, and only about
three hundred to four hundred feet above sea-level. The native
inhabitants were conquered—often with much cruelty and
treachery—by the Hova, about fifty years previous to the date
of our visit, but the cruelties of the wars carried on by the armies
of Radàma I. and Rànavàlona I. were not forgotten. Over
large districts, all the male population whose heads were above
the armpits of the soldiers were ruthlessly shot down or speared,
and the women and children taken as slaves, so that a large
proportion of the slave population of Imèrina were descended
from the tribes in these south-eastern districts. Since then,
the people quietly submitted to the superior power; but these
military posts were still maintained with governors, officers,
and a small force of soldiers; and at most of them there was
a considerable display of military authority, the gates being
guarded, and the drum beaten at regular times every morning
and evening. With one notable exception, we were everywhere
received with the greatest kindness and respect. Abundant
presents of food for us and our men were brought wherever we
stopped; every facility was given us to speak to the people,
and we were helped in every way to prosecute our journey.</p>

<p>The country between Ambòhipèno and Màhamànina was
varied by low hills in all directions, and patches of wood, the
traveller’s tree appearing in great numbers. The fruit of this
beautiful tree was seen very conspicuously, forming three or four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
clusters of sheaths, about a dozen in each, much resembling
the horns of a short-horned ox. These project from between
the leaf-stalks, two in full bloom, and the other two generally
dying off, or shedding the seeds, or rather the seed-pods. These
are oval in shape, about two inches long, and yellow in colour,
something like very large dates. These, when ripe, open and
show each pod dividing into three parts, each of which is double,
thus containing six rows of seeds about the size of a small bean.
But what seems very curious is, that each seed is wrapped in a
covering exactly like a small piece of blue silk with scalloped
edges. I could not get these, however, without some difficulty
from the ants, which swarmed all over trunk, leaf-stalks, and
leaves, and resented vigorously any intrusion into their domains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A LARGE GOVERNMENT HOUSE</div>

<p>At Màhamànina we found old friends in the governor and
his wife. The <em>làpa</em> or government house was the largest and
finest house I had ever seen in Madagascar, except the chief
palace in the capital. It was three storeys high, entirely of
timber, with stout verandah posts and very high-pitched roof;
and everything here, gateways, guard-houses and stockades,
was of the most substantial character, and made of fine massive
timbers. After two days’ stay we proceeded farther south, and
at the village where we encamped for the night we noticed a new
style of coiffure among the women. Some of them had their
hair done in two rows of little balls, while behind the head there
was a piece of hollow wood ornamented with brass-headed nails
and fastened into the hair. In this they kept their needles and
other small property. Beads also were a good deal worn, and
they had the <em>lòndo</em> or square mat on the back. At one village
the young women wear round the breast a broad band of neatly
woven straw, ornamented with a variety of patterns in different
colours. It was rather difficult to understand the talk of the
people; the nasal <em>n</em>, the peculiar intonation, and the pronouns
and adverbs being all different from the Hova forms, made their
conversation a puzzle to us. Some, if not all the people here,
are a Sàkalàva colony from the west of the island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EVIDENCE OF VOLCANIC ACTION</div>

<p>We came the next day to a very boggy and difficult rice-valley.
Hereabouts the people make their <em>vàlam-parìhy</em>, or low
earthen banks between the rice-fields, with a foundation of
small stakes stuck in the ground, apparently to hold the earth
together, as it seems less tenacious and binding than that in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
Imèrina. When a good deal of the earth has been washed
away, it may easily be imagined that it is not a pleasant thing
walking along these banks. During the afternoon we passed for
some time over a slightly hollow tract thickly covered with
rounded lumps of dark brown rock resembling slag or scoria,
and full of holes like those produced by air-bubbles when the
mass was in a state of fusion. These were of all sizes, from a
yard or two to an inch in diameter, while the ground was
covered with rounded pebbles of the same material, of the size
of small beans. This must surely have been the bed of some
ancient stream, long since diverted into other channels by
subsequent elevation of the surface. But whence was this
volcanic substance derived? For many miles westward there
seems no broken or rugged surface, nor anything to indicate
subterranean disturbance. Probably the great isolated mountain
of Ivòhibé, which we have seen for several days far away
to the west, is an extinct volcano, like so many hills farther
north; and the ancient stream has at some remote period cut
through a dyke of lava and brought the rolled and rounded
fragments down its bed.</p>

<p>Walking about in the brilliant moonlight after our evening
meal, in a short time there was quite a crowd gathered together
to watch the extraordinary spectacle of two foreigners walking
backwards and forwards for no discoverable earthly purpose.
After a little while we stopped and began to talk to them, telling
them of the old, but to them perfectly new, story of the glad
tidings, and of that “faithful saying” which was worthy of
their, and of all men’s, “acceptation.”</p>

<p>Travelling again towards the shore, we passed for some time
through country which was like a beautiful shrubbery, with low
trees, amongst which the <em>vòavòntaka</em>, with its perfectly globular
green or yellow fruit, the size of a large orange, was very plentiful
and conspicuous. There was also a tree, the <em>karàbo</em>, having
enormous pods with seeds like beans, but from two to three
inches in diameter. We passed fresh evidence of volcanic
action in ancient streams of lava, with sand and dust from some
long extinct crater. Stopping at sunset at a village called
Màhavèlona, we found it, notwithstanding its promising name
(“causing to live”), the filthiest spot we had seen in all our
journey, quite worthy of the name given by a friend to a place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
he stopped at, of “the well-dunged village.” We could find
no space where the tent could be pitched, and so began to look
for a house. There was one in the centre of the village that
looked of fair size, but the difficulty was, how to get to it, for it
was surrounded for a considerable distance by a slough of mud
and cow-dung that took our men nearly up to their knees.
Happily there were a few stout planks lying near, and with
these we made a causeway over the bog.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TRAVELLER’S TREE</div>

<p>The following day, while waiting in the belt of wood bordering
the shore, we had an opportunity of testing the accuracy of
accounts given of the water procurable from the traveller’s tree,
about which, although backed by the authority of Mr Ellis,
and an illustration in his “Three Visits to Madagascar,” I had
always felt rather sceptical, as somewhat of “a traveller’s tale.”
In fact I had never before seen the tree where plenty of good
water was not to be had; but here there was none for several
miles except the stagnant, brackish and offensive water of the
lagoon. (Even my friend, Baron, says that the tree is always
found where good water is procurable.) But we found that on
piercing with a spear or a pointed stick the lower part of one of
the leaf-stalks, where they all clasp one over the other, a small
stream of water spurted out, from which one could drink to the
full of good, cool, and sweet water. If one of the outer leaf-stalks
was forcibly pulled down, a quantity of water gushed out,
so that we afterwards filled a vessel with as much as we needed.
On examining a section of one of the stalks, a hollow channel
about half-an-inch in diameter is seen running all down the inner
side of the stalk from the base of the leaf. The large cool
surface of the leaves appears to collect the water condensed from
the atmosphere, and this is conducted by the little channel
downward to the base. The leaf-stalks are all full of cells and of
water, like those of the banana. After three hours’ walking
along the shore in the heavy sand, with a hot sun overhead, we
were grateful to be able to draw from these numberless vegetable
springs, and we thanked God for the traveller’s tree; we felt
that its name was no misnomer. We afterwards found in a
village not far away that small water-pots were placed in a
hollow cut at the base of the leaves, so as to collect water for
drinking and household use.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN UNEXPECTED PROHIBITION</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<p>After five days’ journey from Màhamànina we reached a
village near Vangàindràno, another of the large Hova posts,
and about three hours’ ride from the sea. But here we met
with a new and unexpected experience, for we were prevented
by the governor from going farther, and in fact, all our men
made prisoners and detained in the fort for a couple of days,
until we had agreed that we would not attempt to travel farther
southwards. He alleged that he was acting under orders from
the native government to allow no travelling south of the
Mànanàra river. Whether this was the truth or not, we never
clearly ascertained, nor any reason for such prohibition; but
his whole action was in such striking contrast to the courtesy
with which we were received everywhere else that it was
difficult to believe he was not exceeding his instructions,
certainly in the harsh way in which they were carried out. We
had been repeatedly assured that there were no difficulties in
travelling along the coast and that the country was perfectly
tranquil, and that we could easily reach Fort Dauphine in a
week. However, there was no help for it; we had to abandon
our hope of seeing the congregations and people, as well as the
country, to the south, and on 11th July we turned northwards,
“homeward bound.” On one of the nights when we were thus
stopped on our way, we saw what is not at all a common sight—namely,
a very well-defined and distinct lunar rainbow. It
looked pale and watery, however, quite a ghost of the rainbow
produced by sunlight. During many years’ residence in
Madagascar, I have only seen one on two other occasions.</p>

<p>On the sides of the lagoons and marshes may be found the
curious pitcher-plant (<i>Nepenthes</i>). It is a shrub, about four
feet high, and its jug-shaped pitchers, four or five inches in
length, contain abundant water and numerous insects. The
pitcher with its cover are most remarkable modifications of the
petiole or leaf-stalk; and this plant, with a number of others,
reverses the usual order of nature, and instead of forming food
for animals, secures animal life, in the shape of insects, for its
own nourishment. A French writer has, not inaptly, compared
the pitcher of <i>Nepenthes</i> to the bowl of a German meerschaum
pipe; and Mr Scott Elliott says: “I found the pitchers to be
usually from a third to half full of the decomposing remains of
insects. In almost every pitcher there were live worms,
apparently living on the remains. Among the insects I found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
thirteen species of beetle, ten species of butterfly or moth, seven
species of hemiptera (aphides, water-beetles, etc.); four species
of hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants, etc.), of which one was a
sand-wasp, nearly an inch long; twelve species of diptera
(mosquitoes, flies, etc.), two grasshoppers, two dragonflies, and
one spider.” The water contained in the pitchers apparently
contains some acid or other solvent, by which the insects are
slowly digested by the plant; and from the above account it
will be seen what a great variety of insect life is entrapped,
including even the largest and strongest insects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A SUGAR-CANE PRESS</div>

<p>On one of the afternoons when we were detained near Vangàindràno,
hearing a sugar-cane press at work at one end of
the village, we went to look at it in operation. Like many others
we saw on this coast, it consisted of a long hollowed-out trough,
one end being left solid for a foot or two, thus forming a slightly
convex surface, with a channel cut on either side for the expressed
juice to run into the trough. Over this and across it
was a rounded tree trunk, seven or eight feet long, with three
short handles fixed into it; this is turned backwards and
forwards over small pieces of cane placed on the convex surface,
the juice being expressed by the mere weight of the round
trunk. The freshly expressed juice makes a pleasant drink;
after a day or two it begins to ferment, and is then much like
fresh cider; but it rapidly becomes too heady and intoxicating.
A good deal of <em>tòaka</em> (rum) is made, and is a cause of much evil
among the coast tribes; but the people here appear not to
understand the manufacture of sugar. Their still is as rude a
contrivance as their press; an earthen pot to boil the juice, and
a piece of iron piping fixed through a vessel of cold water so as
to condense the steam which forms the spirit.</p>

<p>The people in this part of the country, who are called Taisàka,
all wear mats, as do the Tanàla and the Taimòro. To fasten
the mat sack about their waists, they use a girdle of bark cloth.
Some of this cloth (called <em>fànto</em>) is made by stripping off the
bark of certain trees, so that the whole comes off in one piece,
forming a kind of long bag, but open at each end. Another
kind is made in a sheet of about six feet long by four wide. It is
prepared by being hammered for a considerable time with a
wooden mallet, the face of which is cut in cross lines. This is
chiefly women’s work. Very few of the people had any garment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
made of woven cloth, indeed they seem to have little, if any,
knowledge of spinning or weaving. On the other hand, they
are clever in straw-work and in manufacturing mats and
baskets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TAISÀKA HOUSES</div>

<p>Their houses are very small, made of a slight framework and
filled in with the midrib of the leaves of the traveller’s tree
in the same way that the <em>zozòro</em> (papyrus) is used in Imèrina,
and looking almost exactly like <em>zozòro</em>. These leaf-stalks,
which are called <em>falàfa</em>, are fixed together on long fine twigs so
as to make a kind of stiff mat, the triangular stems easily fitting
in alternately. These mats are the ordinary mattress, and are
used in various other ways. One of them forms the door on
either side of the house, being shifted to one side or another as
required, and is kept from falling by sliding within a pole hung
from the framework. The flooring, which is always raised above
the ground, is made of the bark of the traveller’s tree, pressed
flat so as to form a rough kind of boarding; while the thatch of
every house is the leaves of the same tree, which forms a neat
and fairly durable covering. Here also, as among the other
coast tribes which we have seen, the traveller’s tree might be
called with equal or greater propriety, “the builder’s tree.”
The hearth is at one end of the house, in the centre, with a
strong square framework above it, having two or three rows of
shelves. The <em>tràno àmbo</em>, or elevated house for storing rice,
seems common to every tribe we have visited since leaving the
Bétsiléo province. The villages here are arranged in groups of
from two to half-a-dozen in a line, and with only a small space
between each group.</p>

<p>The rice-fields in this flat swampy district have a very
different appearance to those in Imèrina or Bétsiléo; they are
like immense pits, in some places dug out to some depth in the
sides of the low elevations. The people do not transplant their
rice, as do those of the central provinces, but reap it where it
has been sown. We continually came across traces of volcanic
action; ancient streams of lava, conical-shaped hills and, on
the coast, reefs of basalt rock, gradually being broken up by
the action of the waves. All this showed that the great groups
of extinct volcanoes in the central provinces had their counterpart
in these southern regions of the island. Another interesting
fact was, that we found unmistakable signs also of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
Secondary rocks here on the coast, in stratified sandstone tilted
up at a very high angle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MILITARY ESCORT</div>

<p>A day and a half’s journey from Vangàindràno brought us to
another Hova military post, a town called Ankàrana, which is
situated on a ridge about four hundred feet above the general
level of the surrounding country, forming a striking feature
in the landscape. Ascending a slippery and steep road in the
red clay, I found myself at one o’clock on the top of the ridge
and close to the stockaded <em>ròva</em>, or Hova fort, a much larger
place than I had expected to see, as hardly anything of the town
could be seen from below. Mr Street, being ill with fever, had
gone on before, while I brought up the rear. Coming to the
gate of the stockade, my men were about to take me in at once,
but the people near requested me to stop, as the officers were
coming out to escort me in. This I rather unwillingly did, as a
very heavy shower came on just then. Presently the rolling of
drums announced their approach. First came a file of soldiers,
then a number of officers, then the lieutenant-governor in palanquin,
and then the governor in ditto, a little active old man in
regimental red coat and cocked hat. They all came forward and
shook hands, and evidently it was intended that the queen
should be saluted and polite speeches made; but the rain
pelted down so furiously just then that they thought better of
it, and we made our way through the double stockade into the
Hova town with its lines of houses, and then into an inner
stockade enclosing the government house and flagstaff and
several large houses. We took shelter under the raised verandah
of one of these, while a dozen unfortunate individuals, soldiers
and petty officers, had to stand out in the pouring rain and
“present arms,” “support arms,” etc., and then, of course,
came inquiries after the queen and the great people at their
capital.</p>

<p>The governor then led me into the temporary <em>làpa</em>, a large
rough-looking room, where was a table spread with dishes,
plates, etc. He apologised for there being no meal ready for
us, as our coming was unexpected, but wine and biscuits were
brought and we drank the queen’s health, and they drank ours,
a flourish of music and drums following each toast. This
extreme politeness, so soon after the marked discourtesy shown
us at Vangàindràno, astonished and amused me not a little. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
was gravely consulted as to whether the royal flag might not be
hauled down, as the day was so wet; I accordingly graciously
signified my approval of their doing so. As soon as possible, I
intimated that I would like to go and see my friend and companion.
The governor leading the way, I was taken to a house
at the far end of the enclosure, where I found Mr Street in bed
and very unwell. But the house was large and dry, a fire was
burning on the hearth, and we were glad to get our wet things
dried. Several of our men were also ill with fever, so I had my
hands pretty full with dispensing medicine and nursing. Besides
this, numerous callers had to be talked with and presents
received.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A NOISY DINNER</div>

<p>A good part of the following day was occupied in conversation
with the native pastors, examining the school, teaching,
singing, etc. But soon after four o’clock in the afternoon
the sound of music and drumming in the courtyard told us that
the time was approaching for the feast they were going to give
us, and presently the governor and all his people came to fetch
us. My companion was unable to go, but I was led by the
hand and had to receive all the honours. In the open central
space all the military force of the town, about five and twenty
soldiers, was drawn up, and the royal flag was flying. On one
side the ladies, the wives and daughters of the officers, were
arranged, dressed in their best; on the other side were row after
row of pots with fires under them, where the feast was being
cooked. There was a terrible din of drumming and music
going on. After a prayer, salutes, speech-making, including a
long flourish of our honour, and presentation of another immense
heap of provisions, I was again taken by the hand, and led
into the government house for the repast. I should add that
the governor also gave us ten dollars for <em>vàtsy</em> (food by the way),
counting them into my hand in English numbers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A LONG MENU</div>

<p>The dinner was, I think, the longest, and certainly <em>was</em> the
noisiest, entertainment at which I have ever assisted. About
a score of the officers were at the table, and seven of the ladies.
After a long grace from the pastor, dinner was brought in, and
consisted of the following courses:—1st, curry; 2nd, goose;
3rd, roast pork; 4th, pigeons and water-fowls; 5th, chicken
cutlets and poached eggs; 6th, beef sausages; 7th, boiled
tongue; 8th, sardines; 9th, pigs’ trotters; 10th, fried bananas;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
11th, pancakes; 12th, manioc; 13th, dried bananas; and
last, when I thought everything must have been served, came
hunches of roast beef! All this was finished up with coffee.
By taking a constantly diminishing quantity of each dish I
managed to appear to do justice to them all. Claret went about
very freely, and at length some much stronger liquor; and the
healths of the Queen, “Our friends the two Foreigners,” then
those of the Prime Minister, Chief Secretary, and Chief Judge,
were all drunk twice over, the Governor’s coming last; all followed
by musical (and drum) honours. As already remarked,
it was the noisiest affair of the kind at which I have ever been
present. There was a big drum just outside in the verandah,
as well as two small ones, besides clarionets and fiddles, and
these were in full play almost all the time. Then the room was
filled by a crowd of servants and aides-de-camp, and the shouting
of everybody to everybody, from the governor downwards,
was deafening. The old gentleman directed everything and
everyone, filled up everybody’s glass, and, in fact, filled up his
own more often than was quite good for him, so that he became
a little incoherent in the last toasts he proposed; so that I was
glad when the finishing one arrived, and I could take my leave
after nearly two hours’ sitting. But I was not to leave quietly;
again I was taken by the hand, the big drum being hammered
at in front of us all the way, and, followed by a posse of officers
and ladies, was escorted home by the governor. My invalid
friend could well have dispensed with the big drum; however,
being a little better, he and I managed to say a few earnest
words to them about “the praying”; after which they took
their leave. I had afterwards to pay quite a round of visits
to our men who were poorly, some with fever, others lame, with
feet hurt with thorns, stumbling, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MELANCHOLY PARTING</div>

<p>It was fine on the following morning, and as my companion’s
fever had left him, although he was still very weak, we determined
to get off; but first, there were more visits to be paid,
and more presents to be received. Mr Street left first at half-past
nine, but I waited until all the baggage was off, and then
went to wish our old friend the governor good-bye. But I was
not to get away so easily; I was again taken into the chief
house, the claret was brought out, and the Queen’s health and
our own drunk with military honours. Then I turned to say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
<em>Velòma</em>; but no, the vigorous old gentleman was going to
escort me out of town, and his wives were to accompany us.
But some time elapsed in seeking bearers for them, during
which I had to go to the lieutenant-governor’s and drink coffee.
On returning to the courtyard I found the governor putting a
couple of bottles of claret and another of rum into his palanquin,
as well as glasses and cups. Sufficient bearers could not be
procured for the ladies, so we wished them good-bye, and set
off in the following order:—Soldiers, musicians, with drums,
clarionet, and violin; “<em>ny havantsika ny Vazàha</em>” (our foreign
friend); the lieutenant-governor; the governor; aides-de-camp,
soldiers. And so escorted, with the drums, etc., in full play, we
marched out of the town. I had supposed that as soon as we
were fairly at the foot of the hill the governor would take his
leave, but he went on and on for an hour until we came to a
rapid stream, the Mànantsìmba. Here we halted; the claret
was poured out for more health-drinking, with musical honours;
and then the whole of the governor’s men were ordered to take
me safely across the river, which they did. From the opposite
bank I bowed and shouted my last adieux, and so parted
from one of the jolliest old gentlemen I have ever met with
in my travels. It struck me as irresistibly comic that, as
soon as we had fairly started on our way from the river
bank, the musicians struck up a most melancholy strain.
As my men said, the governor appeared to be low-spirited
at parting with us.</p>

<p>I must add a word or two more about this “fine old <em>Malagasy</em>
gentleman, all of the olden time.” It appeared that he had
been governor at Ankàrana for more than twenty years, and
before then was lieutenant-governor at Mànanjàra. We were
somewhat shocked to find that each of the three buxom ladies
who accompanied him about was his wife, and further, that he
had another as well, whom we did not see. The pastor told
us that he had been admonished as to the impropriety of his
conduct in this respect, but he had been unable as yet to make
up his mind which of them to put away, and which to keep,
out of the four. He seemed quite a little king in the district
he commanded, and our servants told us that he was a most
courageous old fellow, delighted to hear of there being any
enemies to be met with anywhere, and going off to fight them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
with the greatest alacrity. Yesterday, when the feast was
being cooked, he sat in the courtyard, gun in hand, shooting
first a fowl, then a pigeon, and then a pig, all of which, in
addition to what was already preparing, he ordered to be instantly
cooked with the rest. They also say that he is very
rich, owning five hundred cattle and two hundred slaves, and
that he is always most hospitable to all strangers. Certainly
we found him to be so. Besides the abundant kindness he
showed us at Ankàrana, he sent with us an escort and guides,
twelve soldiers, two officers, and a drummer, besides as many
baggage bearers as we required to replace the men who were
ill.</p>

<p>We were interested to find that many of our bearers met with
relatives in these coast provinces. The mothers of several of
them were brought up from these parts as slaves, when children,
in Radàma’s cruel wars. The most remarkable circumstance
was that our cook discovered that one of the governor’s wives
at Ankàrana was his mother’s sister. And at the same place
another of our men found that the chief people of the Taisàka
village were his mother’s brothers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRIMITIVE DISHES AND SPOONS</div>

<p>Our lodging on the evening of the day we left Ankàrana was
in another sample of the “well-dunged village,” although we
procured a tolerably good house in it. While taking lunch in
one of the other villages, we noticed the primitive dishes and
spoons used by the people. The former consist of the strong
tough leaf of the pandanus-tree, which is doubled over at one
end so as to retain rice or liquid. The spoons are pieces of the
leaf of the traveller’s tree, folded up so as easily to carry food
to the mouth. This pandanus has a fruit, yellow in colour, and
something in shape and size like a pineapple without its tuft
of leaves. When dry it is brown in colour, and each hexagonal
division when separated from the rest is like a tough wooden
peg, and utterly uneatable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FUNERAL MEMORIAL</div>

<p>Outside a village called Iàboràno I noticed the first appearance
of anything like a funeral memorial we have seen since leaving
Bétsiléo. This consisted of four poles placed in a line, the two
outer ones higher than the others, and the inner ones pointed
in a peculiar fashion. These serve the same purpose as the
upright stones called <em>tsàngam-bàto</em> in Imèrina. All through
the Tanàla country and along this south-eastern coast we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
have seen no graves or memorials of the dead. I was told
that each village has a large pit in, or on the borders of,
the forest, where the dead are thrown and are not covered
with earth. The corpses are wrapped in coarse matting
made of rush.</p>

<br />
<span class="fs70">THE SOUTH-EASTERN PEOPLES</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">ON the Saturday afternoon we reached Ambàhy, a large
village not far from the sea, with a <em>ladoàna</em> or custom-house.
Here a detachment of military awaited our
arrival—viz. <em>four</em> officers and <em>two</em> soldiers, but outside and inside
the stockade rather more than the usual amount of tedious
ceremony was gone through, which was, however, amusing as
well, from the absurd costume of many of the performers.</p>

<p>On the Sunday, as my companion was still unwell, I took the
services entirely. The church was in the village on the other
side of the water, and in going over to service I had a sail for the
first time in a native-made <em>built boat</em>. These boats are here
called <em>sàry</em>, and are about thirty feet long by eight feet beam,
and easily carry fifty people. I examined with interest the construction
of the craft, for the planks, about eight inches broad,
were <em>tied</em>, not nailed together, by twisted cord of <em>anìvona</em> palm
fibre, one of the toughest known vegetable substances, the holes
being plugged with hard wood. The seat boards came right
through the sides, so as to stiffen the whole, for there were no
ribs or framework. The seams were caulked with strips of
bamboo, loops of which also formed the rowlocks for large oars
of European shape. The ends of the boat curved upwards considerably,
and from its appearance it seemed likely to stand
a heavy sea with perfect safety. These boats are made for
going out to the shipping, for no dug-out canoe could live in
the great waves constantly rolling along these shores.</p>

<p>From Ambàhy northwards there stretches a coral reef at a
mile or two’s distance from the beach, a white line of surf
constantly breaking over it. Along this part of the coast the
vegetation of pandanus is varied by a number of the tall graceful
<em>filào</em>-trees (casuarina), so common south of Tamatave. It
was dusk before all the baggage and our men were ferried
over a small river, and as I was the last I had a most unpleasant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
hour and a half in the dark, floundering about in rice-fields and
water, for our guides lost their way, so that I thought we should
have to take shelter under some bush for the night. But at
last we reached a good-sized village; two of our men, however,
got hopelessly astray and had to lie out all night in the open.
In the dark we several times thought we saw a lantern coming
to our aid, but it was only the beautiful little fireflies dancing
up and down in the bushes, a “will-o’-the-wisp” which deceived
us again and again. These flies do not give a continuous
light, but one which—like some lighthouses—is quenched every
second or two, the interval of darkness being longer than the
time when the light is visible.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CANOE CHANTS</div>

<p>We were delayed on our journey one day by having to return
and search for a man who had been missing for a day or more.
Leaving our stopping-place before six in the morning, I took
sixteen men, who were divided into three parties to go in different
directions. We did not find him, but discovered where he was,
and left him in charge of some Hova officers to be sent on after
us. I had two voyages over the Màtitànana that day; the
morning’s sail was delightful, the water smooth as a mirror,
and with a very large canoe and eight or ten paddles we moved
rapidly over the glassy surface. My men began and sustained
for some time several of their musical and often amusing canoe
chants, in which one man keeps up a recitative, usually an
improvised strain, often bringing in circumstances recently
happening, while the rest chime in with a chorus at regular
intervals, a favourite one being, “<em>E, misy và?</em>” (“Oh, is
there any?”). This question refers to various good things they
hope to get at the end of the day’s journey, such as plenty of
rice, beef, sweet potatoes, etc., these articles of food being
mentioned one after another by the leader of the song. A little
delicate flattery of their employer, the Englishman they are
rowing, is often introduced, and praises of his hoped-for generosity
in providing these luxuries for them, something in this
style:</p>

<p class="noindent">and so on, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i>.</p>

<p>In another song sung by men on this voyage, the chorus was,
<em>Mandàny vàtsy, Toamasina malaza é!</em>—<em>i.e.</em> “Consumes provisions
for the way, famous Tamatave O!”—while the recitative
brought in all the different villages on the journey from Tamatave
to the capital, ending with Avàra-dròva, the northern
entrance to the palace yard. Our return voyage was a rough
one; there was a considerable swell, for the sea breeze had set
in very strongly, as is generally the case in the afternoon along
the east coast; and had I not had an unusually large and good
canoe, I dared not have ventured across the broad expanse of
water near the mouth of the river.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp75" id="p2721_ill" style="max-width: 37.5em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Malagasy Orchid</span> (Angræcum Superbum)<br />

The blooms are pure white, waxlike flowers</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">MAGNIFICENT ORCHIDS</div>

<p>While waiting for the canoe that afternoon I was delighted
to see the profusion of orchids along the shore. I had, of course,
often admired these on the trunks and branches of trees on the
coast; but, here, the magnificent <i><ins class="corr" id="tn-272" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Agræcum superbum'">
Angræcum superbum</ins></i> was
growing by hundreds on the ground, on good-sized bushes,
which occurred in scores, the large waxy-white flowers all in
full bloom. It was worth a fatiguing journey to see such a
wealth of floral beauty. Here I may notice that another fine
orchid, the <i>Angræcum sesquipedale</i>, is also to be seen in flower
in the months of June and July on this eastern coast. It is
not so numerous in blooms as the other species, but its large
pure white flowers shine out like stars against the dark trunks
of the trees on which it grows. As its specific name signifies,
its remarkable spur or nectary is nearly a foot and a half long,
pointing to an insect with a very long sucking tube in order to
reach the honey stored there. There are several other species
of <i>Angræcum</i> found in Madagascar, but with smaller flowers
than the two just named. As Mr Baron remarks, “Whatever
else may escape the notice of the traveller, the <i>A.
superbum</i> forms far too striking an ornament to be passed by
unheeded.” And I think the same might almost be said of
the <i>sesquipedale</i>; of this latter Mr Baron says that it generally
chooses trees which overhang the rivers or lagoons as its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
habitat. I have, however, noticed it at some distance from
water.</p>

<p>Farther north along this coast there is a large proportion of
trees of considerable size, in addition to the pandanus and more
shrubby vegetation seen farther south. The latter also attain
a much greater height in the struggle to get up to the light
amongst the crowd of other trees. In one spot for some distance
there was no undergrowth, but “a pillared shade” of the
slender trunks of the pandanus, while high overhead their
graceful crowns of long saw-edged leaves made a canopy
impervious to the sun. Among the larger trees one called <em>atàfa</em>
(<i>Terminalia catappa</i>) is prominent; in these the branches strike
directly at right angles from the trunk and then spread away
horizontally for a considerable distance. The leaves are
spatula-shaped and from eight to ten inches long, and a large
proportion of them are always a ruddy brown or scarlet, giving
a blaze of colour. The tree is called also the “Indian almond,”
and the kernel of the fruit is edible. While waiting for a canoe,
we walked two or three hundred yards towards the outlet of a
small river, and were startled by a crocodile only a few feet
in front of us, rousing himself from his nap in the setting sunshine,
and waddling off into the river.</p>

<p>About seventy miles north of the Màtitànana river we came
to an extensive lagoon stretching northward for several miles.
This appeared to be the first—from the south—of that remarkable
series bordering the shore and extending with but few
breaks nearly to Tamatave, a distance of two hundred and
sixty miles (see <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a>). Along the northern side of
this lagoon are masses of lava rock, some of it in enormous
blocks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TAIMÒRO TRIBE</div>

<p>We found here that we had reached another centre of population,
an important settlement of the Taimòro tribe; the
principal chief, a very fine tall man, came to see us, and was extremely
polite and kind. We were amused to see his daughters,
two nice little girls, attended by all the other children of the
village, who were going through the peculiar monotonous
native singing with clapping of hands; while these two girls
moved together slowly backwards and forwards, and with a
slow movement of their feet, and a graceful movement of the
hands, performed a native dance. They were strikingly different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
from the other children in their dress, having scarlet caps, with
a long veil behind of coloured print, jackets of figured stuff
and a skirt of scarlet or a broad girdle of the same colour.
Afterwards they were mounted on the shoulders of two stout
girls, who went through the same performance with their feet,
while the little girls moved their hands and arms.</p>

<p>At a village where we stayed it was the custom that no bird
or animal could be killed for food except by someone belonging
to the family of the native king. This agrees with what is
stated by Drury and other early writers on Madagascar as to

<div class="sidenote">AN OBJECT OF WONDER</div>

<p>On 22nd and 23rd July, Saturday and Sunday, we had two
long and very fatiguing journeys, the more so as our maps were
of the vaguest description, and we could get no accurate information
as to distances or villages; rice for our bearers was
not at all easy to procure, and when crossing rivers, a single
canoe for fifty men and a quantity of baggage often delayed
us very seriously. On the Saturday morning we met a wheeled
vehicle, the first I had ever seen in Madagascar—viz. a cart
drawn by yoked oxen; this excited much wonder among our
men. We had to cross rivers or wide lagoons five times that
day, so that late in the afternoon we still saw no stopping-place.
But as we understood <ins class="corr" id="tn-274" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'that that was a'">
that there was a</ins> small village two
or three hours farther on, and that the road was along the
shore, we thought we could not miss it even if it was late. So
we went along the sands; the sun set, and it grew dark, but
there was no sign of any village; then the path turned inland
among the bush, where we went on feeling our way for some
time. But at last we got hopelessly adrift in the dense vegetation
and total darkness. There was no help for it but to retrace
our steps to the shore, which we did, not without great
difficulty. It seemed highly probable that we should have to
spend the night under the trees, without food, fire, or light,
as our baggage had gone on ahead. Continually we mistook
the light of the fireflies for a lantern coming to our assistance;
but still going on we saw at last a light ahead, steadier and
redder than that of the fireflies. Then we lost it, but going on
again we at length came up to the embers of a fire lighted on the
sand. Opposite was a path leading up to four little huts, where
most of our men had arrived, and where we got better accommodation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
than the woods would have afforded, although the
huts were mere rough sheds of traveller’s tree leaves. It was
fortunate for us that we reached them, for heavy rain came
directly and continued all night. There was no rice to be
bought; so our men had to go supperless to bed, and we had
very little to eat ourselves. Some dozen or more of the men
slept with us in our hut, as thick as they could lie, and the other
places were as full.</p>

</div>

<p>The following day, Sunday, was a disappointing one, for we
quite thought in the morning that we were only two or three
hours’ journey, at most, from Màsindràno, where we hoped to
meet with a good congregation. But we had to travel for hour
after hour, delayed in crossing the lagoons in a vain search for
food, and in other ways, so that it was sunset before we crossed
the Mànanjàra river, and after dark before we at last reached
the town. However, here we met with the kindest welcome,
had good houses put at our disposal, and there was abundance
of food for us all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHALES</div>

<p>On the following day we left the seashore, along which, first
going southwards and afterwards northwards, we had travelled
for so many days. And here I may remark that dolphins are
often seen in the Madagascar seas, especially the small species
called <i>Delphinus pas</i>, which is frequently seen leaping, plunging
and swimming with astonishing swiftness and in large shoals.
These animals love to pursue the flying-fish, and in this chase
they display extraordinary dexterity. Two species of whale
also frequent the seas round Madagascar, but they are chiefly
seen on the western side of the island. The huge form of the
cachelot or sperm-whale, with its remarkably square head,
looking as if it had been cut off right across, especially when it
turns to dive, as I have seen it, seems to have impressed the
imagination of the Malagasy, because when an earthquake
occurs they say, <em>Mivàdika ny tròzona</em>—<em>i.e.</em> “The whales are
turning over.”</p>

<p>After leaving the east coast we sailed up the broad river
Mànanjàra, stopping a night at another Hova military post, a
large village called Itsìatòsika. Here again we had great kindness
shown to us by the most polite and gentlemanly set of Hova
officers we had ever met. For the first day and a half our route
lay chiefly up the valley of the river, over undulating country; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
during the next two and half days we had to travel to the north-west,
through the belt of dense forest covering the lines of
mountain which are the successive steps into the bare interior
highland. Through this rugged country, travelling was very
difficult, and the steep ascents very fatiguing. As we got up a
thousand feet, there was line after line of hill and mountain,
all covered with forest, as far as the eye could reach, to the
north and south and west. Besides the ordinary forest trees,
there were great numbers of the graceful palm called <em>Anìvona</em>,
which, in the struggle for light and heat, here grows to a
great height. As we have seen in speaking of the old style
of timber houses, this palm was made much use of in
their construction. There were magnificent and extensive
views from the higher ground; and conspicuous for a whole
day’s journey was a lofty perpendicular cliff of bright red
rock, rising sheer up many hundreds of feet from the valley
below.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A HEATHENISH FUNERAL</div>

<p>A little before reaching the summit of one ridge we heard a
good deal of noise and shouting ahead of us, and supposed that
the Tanàla were dragging an unusually large piece of timber.
On getting nearer, we found fifty or sixty people, men and
women, and a number of men carrying something, which,
coming closer to them, we found was a child’s coffin, made of
a piece of the trunk of a tree hollowed out, and with a rough
cover of wood fastened on with bands of a strong creeper. This
was being carried with a barbarous kind of chant, but without
the slightest sign of mourning on the part of anyone. It was
the most heathenish kind of funeral we had ever seen. Among
these forest people funerals are called <em>fàndrorìtam-pàty</em> (<em>lit.</em>
“stretching out of the corpse”), and it seems that the coffin
is pulled about first in one direction and then in another
by the different parties of those following it; and it is finally
thrown into some hollow in the woods. It was a saddening
sight.</p>

<p>We found that we had come again among our old friends, the
Tanàla, for in their mats and undressed appearance, and their
use of bark cloth, the women in the villages were just like those
we had seen from Ivòhitròsa downwards.</p>

<p>Our second day in the forest brought us to a height of
fourteen hundred and fifty feet above the sea; and, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
our fatigue from having to walk continually for
several hours, we were charmed again with the luxuriance of
the vegetation. The anìvona-palms shot up their slender
columns, banded with lines of white on dark green to heights
of eighty to a hundred feet, and the traveller’s trees were as
lofty, in the fierce competition for life. The tree-ferns spread
out their graceful fronds over the streams; and the <i>Vaquois
pandanus</i> carried its large clusters of serrated leaves high overhead
to get up to the light. In some places the woods were
very dense, and there was a green twilight as we passed along
the narrow path amongst the crowd of tall trunks. We were
struck by the intense silence of the forest; there was no sound
of animal life, and no voice of bird, or beast, or insect broke
the oppressive stillness. For six hours and a half we hardly
saw a house except isolated woodcutters’ huts; and we were
glad at last to see the sparkling waters of the Mànanjàra
in front of us, and to find a village of twenty houses on its
banks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CICADA</div>

<p>Although in the cold season, which was the time of our
journey, the woods were very silent, they are not so at all times
of the year, and among the sounds of the forest we must not
omit one which, once heard, can never be forgotten—viz. the
extremely shrill piercing note of the <em>Jorèry</em>, a cicada, which
makes the woods ring again with its stridulous reverberations.
If it should happen that two or three of these little creatures
are giving out their sound together, the jarring, ringing noise
becomes almost painful to the ear; and it is difficult to believe
that such a loud noise can be produced from the friction of the
wing-cases of such a comparatively small insect, for it does not
exceed an inch and a half in length.</p>

<p>On rainy nights a stridulous sound, but far less loud than
that produced by the jorèry, is heard in and near the forest, and
is produced by a large species of earthworm called <em>Kànkandoròka</em>.
It somewhat resembles the noise of a rattle, and is far
from unpleasant to the ear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SILENCE OF THE WOOD</div>

<p>Yet it would be a mistake to suppose that these comparatively
silent woods are destitute of animal life, and the stillness
is largely attributable to the peculiar character of the Madagascar
fauna. Many of the lemurs are nocturnal animals and
are therefore not seen or heard in the daytime. Then again,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
the twenty-four species of centetidæ are burrowing animals, and
so do not often appear in the open. And it is much the same
with the sixteen species of rats and mice, which live in the woods
and on their borders. In confirmation of the above remarks as
to the animal life of the forest, it may be stated that in the
latter part of the year 1894, and the beginning of 1895, Dr
Forsyth Major, the eminent naturalist and palæontologist, lived
for several months collecting in the woods not very far from the
route we followed about eighteen years previously; and his
specimens of recent mammals amounted to no fewer than sixteen
hundred specimens, which added <em>twenty species</em> to those
previously known. These were chiefly in the tenrecs and the
rats, but also included a new species of lemur. Some of these
forms were exceptionally interesting, one being aquatic and
web-footed; and others showed transitions from a hairy to a
spiny condition in closely allied animals, suggesting that the
prickly state had been gradually attained for purposes of defence.
Several of the centetidæ, of the genus <i>Oryzorictes</i>, feed largely
on rice, as their generic name denotes, and do much damage to
the crops. This is equally true of the indigenous rats and mice.
We have seen how the forest and coast Malagasy protect their
rice stores by elevated houses, with special precautions against
these little marauders.</p>

<p>It should be added that Dr Major’s unprecedentedly large
collections would probably have been larger still but for the
disturbed state of the country at that time. It was during the
early months of the French invasion and subsequent conquest
of Madagascar, when the feeling against all Europeans was very
strong; so that again and again Dr Major was in considerable
danger of his life. Besides adding so largely to our knowledge
of the living fauna of the island, he made large collections of
the sub-fossil fauna, in collections of the remains of the extinct
æpyornis, hippopotami, tortoises, crocodiles, and other animals,
finding bones of several of the smaller mammals which he afterwards
discovered to be still living.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BIRD LIFE IN MADAGASCAR</div>

<p>With regard to the silence of the wood just spoken of, and
the apparent dearth of animal life, it must be remembered that,
in addition to the character of the mammalian fauna above-mentioned,
our journey was made in the cold season, when all
life is much less in evidence. As we have seen in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
<a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">chapters VIII.</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">IX.</a>, speaking of the forest, it is by no means destitute
of bird life during the warm months of the year. And yet I
have never been able satisfactorily to account for the <em>comparative</em>
fewness of birds in Madagascar, notwithstanding the number
of species. It can hardly be from want of appropriate food, for
the great variety of trees and shrubs must surely supply sufficient
in the way of fruits and berries and seeds, to say nothing
of caterpillars, and insects in various stages of development.
My friend, Mr Cory, an enthusiastic naturalist and sportsman,
wrote to me: “I think the want of bird life in Madagascar is
very marked when compared with England, and I was much
struck with this on my first arrival. I have been in the forest
at all times of the year; and although there <em>are</em> a good many
birds in summer, yet if you try bird’s-nesting here, you will soon
find out how few and far between the nests are.” I have sometimes
thought that these facts may be partly explained by the
rather large proportion of rapacious birds in Madagascar to the
general air-fauna—twenty-two, as compared with two hundred
and ten species known to inhabit the island; for, leaving out
the twenty-eight species of oceanic birds, we have nearly a
seventh of the birds belonging to rapacious kinds, a proportion
which would be still greater if we reckon, as we might well do,
several of the eight species of shrikes as rapacious. As we shall
see in the <a href="#CHAPTER_XXII">next chapter</a>, there appear to be a far larger number
of birds on the western side of the island than are found in the
eastern forests.</p>

<p>With regard to the paucity of insect life in the forest, I think
it has been clearly shown by eminent naturalists like Dr Wallace
and the late Mr Bates, that <em>dense</em> wood is not favourable to such
life; but that in open spaces in the forest, where sunshine can
penetrate, and where there is also water, there is where you
may hope to find butterflies, moths, and various handsome
flies, bees and wasps; while patches of cleared forest and felled
trees are the most favourable hunting-grounds for the numerous
species of beetle and also of ants. In travelling from the east
coast to Imèrina seventeen years later than this journey, on a
route about eighty miles north of that described in this chapter,
we found numerous butterflies, a dozen species at least, in some
localities; and the voice of birds was heard all along the road,
the noisy call of the <em>Kankàfotra</em> cuckoo, <em>kow-kow, kow-kow</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
constantly repeated; the mellow flute-like call of another
cuckoo, the <em>Tolòho</em>, whose notes we heard all the way from
Màhanòro; the chirp and whistle of the <em>Railòvy</em>, or king-crow,
as well as the incessant twitter of many smaller birds. Then
came frequently the wailing notes of the lemurs high up among
the trees. This, however, was in November, when the hot
season was advancing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROTECTIVE COLOURING</div>

<p>In our walks in the forest from the Ankèramadìnika Sanatorium
(Chapters VIII. and IX.), we saw, it will be remembered,
many cases of protective colouring. As we are again in the
eastern forests, the following instances may also be noted.
There is found in these woods a curious walking-stick mantis,
about eight inches long and a quarter of an inch thick. It is
exactly the colour of a dried branchlet or twig, with joints
distinctly articulated like the nodes of many plants. The tail
(if the end of the creature may be thus called) is rather more
than an inch long, and is a hollow, canoe-shaped trough, somewhat
resembling part of the bark torn off a twig. The legs are
alate and spiny. At about two inches from the head are the
wings and wing-sheaths, the latter being somewhat like obovate
stipules about half-an-inch long, and the former marked with
black and yellow and about an inch and a half long. When the
wings are closed, it would take a very keen eye to discover the
creature, as the part of the wing when closed is of the same
colour as the rest of the body. The legs can be brought together
lengthwise in front, and so appear to form a continuous
part of the twig, especially as the femurs are hollowed out to
form a socket for the head.</p>

<p>Another singular creature, a kind of springtail, known as
<em>Tsikòndry</em>, is found on the branches of certain trees. The tail,
which is about half-an-inch long—a little longer than the body
of the insect—is a remarkable and curious appendage. This
tail consists of a tuft of white threads, somewhat divided and
fluffy at the tip, and which, at the pleasure of the insect, can be
raised or lowered or spread out, the threads radiating in a circle
from the root. This tail is so exactly like a lichen in appearance
as thoroughly to deceive the eye. Unless a branch on which
a number of these tsikòndry are seated is accidentally shaken,
causing them to spring off, they would be passed by as lichens.
The leap or spring is effected by a jerk of the tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">PREVOST’S BROADBILL</div>

<p>I have already pointed out somewhere in this book that
Madagascar is a kind of museum of several forms of animal life
found nowhere else in the world; for among mammals there
are some of the lemuridæ, especially the aye-aye; also some
of the centetidæ; among the insects, the uranid butterfly;
while there are several birds, which are isolated, having no near
relation, so that new genera, and even new families, have had to
be formed for their classification. Among these latter, and
inhabiting the eastern forests, is Prevost’s broadbill (<i>Euryceros
prevosti</i>). The zoological affinities of this remarkable bird were
for long a puzzle to ornithologists; but it is so different from
the wood-swallows, starlings and shrikes, which groups are
nearest to it, that the French naturalists have formed a special
family (<i>Eurycerotidæ</i>) for this solitary genus and species. This
bird is remarkable for a beak formed like a very capacious
helmet, strongly compressed and swelled towards the base,
which advances to just as far as the eyes; and its very convex
edge is terminated by a sharp hook. This extraordinary form
of the beak is seen best in the skeleton, in which the beak is seen
to be considerably larger than the skull. The bird is as large as
a starling, velvety black in colour, with a saddle-shaped patch
of light brown on the back. The large beak is steely-blue in
colour, and pearly, like the inside of an oyster shell. Such
specialised birds—as well as the other peculiar forms of life—speak
of high antiquity and of the long isolation of their habitat
from continental influences.</p>

<p>Four or five days of hard travelling brought us to Ambòhimànga,
<em>an-àla</em>, so called to distinguish it from the old Hova
capital of the same name, north of Antanànarìvo. As on many
previous occasions, we had long delays in crossing rivers, from
the fewness and smallness of the canoes available. We were
detained for three hours crossing the Mànanjàra, which,
although so far from the sea, was still a wide river, with a
powerful current and full of rapids and rocks. We had time to
notice and examine carefully a graceful plant which covered
the stones in the water; this looked like a fern—but is not one—from
one to two feet long and with very thick and fleshy stem
and fronds. On examining one of these, I found it to be the
home of a variety of minute animals; some of them caterpillars,
which were burrowing into the stalk; others, small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
green creatures like caddis-worms, but with a transparent shell;
others, minute leeches; others like the fresh-water hydra;
with several other kinds, all finding house and provision on one
frond in the rushing waters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A TANÀLA CHIEFTAINESS</div>

<p>This “forest Ambòhimànga” was the home of Ihòvana,
the Tanàla chieftainess of the tribe of the surrounding district,
who, with her husband, was most kind and friendly, and I
believe a sincere Christian. She was a remarkably stout old
lady, getting grey, and a woman of considerable ability and
force of character. On special occasions, when the Malagasy
nobles and tributary chiefs were summoned up to the capital,
Ihòvana would appear in the public assembly, and with <em>làmba</em>
girded round her and spear in hand, would give assurances of
loyalty and obedience to Queen Rànavàlona, and say “she was
not a woman, but a man,” and would fight, if need be, at the
head of her people in defence of their sovereign.</p>

<p>The situation of this place is exceedingly pleasant, on a hill
about two hundred feet above the river flowing to the east and
north. Around it are hills covered with bamboo, while to the
lines of hill, the edges of the upper plateau are dark with forest.
Here we and our bearers were glad to rest for a couple of
days, including a Sunday, during which we were glad to find
that these northern Tanàla, through Christian teaching and
Ihòvana’s influence, had made wonderful advances compared
with those farther south. There was a congregation of about
three hundred, a school of about as many children, and nine
village congregations connected with the central church
here.</p>

<p>On the Monday morning, on leaving Ambòhimànga, we had to
cross the river at the foot of the hill, and this made the <em>thirtieth</em>
time we had to be ferried across a river with all our men and
property, and glad we were that it was the last. A description
of our water conveyances would include bamboo rafts, canoes
great and small, especially the latter, canoes with one end
rotted away or broken off, and stuffed with clay, and craft so
small that they seemed rather fitted for children’s playthings
than for business. The forest became thinner as we travelled
to the north-west, and this was due to the custom of the Tanàla,
who cut down the woods and sow the rice in the ashes of the
trees which have been burnt; for the people do not plant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
much in one place, but remove their village to another spot
after getting a crop or two. This morning we lost the traveller’s
tree, which does not grow at heights much above two
thousand feet above the sea; and in the afternoon we also lost
sight of the graceful bamboo.</p>

<p>The following morning brought us to steep ascents of nine
hundred and fifty feet, of four hundred and twenty, and then
of six hundred feet successively, the last bringing us to Ivòhitràmbo
(lofty town), well named, for it has a most elevated
situation and higher than a good deal of the interior table-land
to the west. I had noticed all the previous afternoon that on
the very summit of the highest ground to the north was a lofty
cone of rock. Perched upon this like an eagle’s nest was part
of the village, the rest of the houses being a hundred and
forty feet lower. The summit was forty-seven hundred and
fifty feet above the sea; we were now on the high land of
the interior and had come up twenty-four hundred and fifty
feet since we breakfasted. As may be supposed, the view was
most extensive; the plains of North Bétsiléo were not far
distant, and soon we came to the long bare rolling downs of
the central provinces. Uninteresting as these generally appear
after four or five months without rain, they looked home-like, and
the keen air seemed bracing and invigorating. We began to see
rice-fields again and the scattered round <em>vàla</em> of the Bétsiléo.
We had got into the country of a different tribe of people, with
different houses, speech and customs. At the village where
we stopped for the night was a good timber house, with elaborately
carved central pillars, and we began to see again the
carved memorial posts, which had so much interested us on
our journey south.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PECULIAR TOMBS</div>

<p>We noticed again the peculiar tombs of the Bétsiléo; these,
which consist of a large square of stones, are not, as in Imèrina,
the real burial-places; for the actual tomb is often twenty feet
below the ground, a stone chamber, to which access is gained by
a long inclined passage opening out at a distance of eighty or a
hundred feet from the tomb.</p>

<p>And now, as we reached the oft-trodden route between
Antanànarìvo and Fianàrantsòa, this record may come to a
close. We arrived safely at the capital on 5th August, having
been away nearly eleven weeks, and having travelled by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
palanquin, on foot, and in canoes, more than nine hundred
miles.</p>


<div class="footnote">

<div class="sidenote">FIREFLIES</div>

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">[30]</a> These fireflies are not seen in the interior except in two or
three localities, where portions of the original forest still cover
the mountains on which old towns were built. I have seen
them at Vòhilèna, a hill about fifteen hundred feet high, near
the valley of the Mànanàra river, in North Imèrina.</p>

<br />
<span class="fs70">TO SÀKALÀVA LAND AND THE NORTH-WEST</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">AS the contents of former chapters in this book show, I
was able on various occasions during the first few years
of residence in Madagascar to make journeys in different
directions: from the east coast to the interior; from Imèrina
to Antsihànaka; from Imèrina again to Bétsiléo and from
thence to the south-east, visiting the Tanàla, the Taimòro, and
other tribes in that part of the island, not to mention shorter
journeys in the central province itself, to Itàsy and other places.
But the north-west of the country and the districts occupied
by the Sàkalàva people were still unknown to me, so I was
glad when in 1877 there came the opportunity of traversing
this portion of the great island.</p>

<p>For a long time past Tamatave had been—as it still is—the
most frequented port of Madagascar, but the western ports,
from their proximity to South Africa, were sure to increase in
importance. Not very long before the above-mentioned date,
the British India Steam Navigation Company had begun a
service of steamers from Aden to Mozambique, touching at
Mojangà, on the north-west coast, both on the outward and the
return journeys. This appeared to give Europeans living here a
good opportunity of reaching England, avoiding the unpleasant
experience of the “bullocker” (see <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a>), between
Tamatave and Port Louis, and taking a mail steamer direct
from Madagascar. As we were leaving this country for Europe
in September 1877, we determined to take this new route,
which, although a little longer than that by Tamatave, was far
less difficult, besides being partly by canoes, and the last day or
two by a dhow, thus giving a pleasant variety to the journey.
Our party consisted of seven, including my wife and self and
three children—Willie, aged six; May, aged three, and a baby
girl of ten months—Frank Briggs, about the same age as our
boy, whom we were taking home (his father joined us a day or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
two later), and my former fellow-traveller, Mr Louis Street. I
ought also to include a Mozambique nurse, one of those African
slaves recently set free, in accordance with an agreement made
between the English and the Malagasy governments.</p>

<p>We left Antanànarìvo on Thursday afternoon, 13th September,
a large number of our missionary friends accompanying us for
a distance out of the city, in fact as far as the banks of the
Ikòpa, along which our route lay for several miles. Here one
could not but be again impressed with the importance of these
river banks in preserving the rice-fields from being flooded, and
by the good work done by the old kings of Imèrina in embanking
the river and thus turning marsh and bog into fruitful fields.
Stopping at the L.M.S. mission station of Ambòhidratrìmo for
the first night of our journey, we reached the station of Fihàonana
in Vònizòngo on the second day, putting up at the manse,
although the minister (Rev. T. T. Matthews) and his family were
away from home. A short half-day’s ride brought us to a third
mission station, that at Fierènana, where we had a Sunday’s
rest before setting out on the unknown and principal portion of
our journey. We stayed in the house which, a year or two
before then, I had marked out for our friends, and recalled how
I had taught Mrs Stribling to lay bricks, to bond together the
corners of the walls, to manage the chimney breasts, etc., so
that she became quite proficient and was able to teach the
native workmen bricklaying, which was then to them an
unknown art.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ATTRACTIONS OF A MARKET</div>

<p>On Monday morning we fairly started on our journey away
from mission stations and Europeans. Two hours’ ride brought
us to a large market where hundreds of people were assembled.
We were set down and, before we knew what our men were
about, were left almost without a bearer, it being too great a
temptation for our fellows not to go into the thick of a market;
and it was some little time before we could get hold of them to
carry us into the village near the place. All this day’s journey
was up a long wide valley enclosed by lines of hills, which
gradually approached as we proceeded; and our evening halt
was in a village covered with a layer of finely powdered cow-dung,
although the village chapel, our usual inn on such journeys,
provided a fairly comfortable resting-place for the night.</p>

<p>Outside this village the following morning we passed a shoe—or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
rather sandal—market, with scores of pairs of rough bullock-hide
sandals for sale. I noticed also that everyone we passed
carried a pair fastened to his or her burdens. Although we had
to go up and, of course, down again, a long ascent, the route
was less difficult and fatiguing than are those we often traversed
in Imèrina, and far less so than the roads to the eastern coast
through the forest. The increasing temperature told us that
we were getting to a lower level; indeed all the western side of
Madagascar is hotter than the eastern side, as it is deprived of
the cool south-east trade-wind from the Indian Ocean. At the
village where we stopped for the night, all the dwelling-houses
were made of the gigantic bamboo-like grass called <em>bàraràta</em>,
although the school church which served us for a lodging was of
clay. The place had a double entrance gateway, one of them
being a low narrow tunnel; and like most of these villages had
a great quantity of cattle brought into it, for security every
evening. In consequence, the whole place was covered with
a foot or two of manure; and it was here that our friend, Mr
Grainge, stopping for the night the previous year, had an
experience which I will give in his own words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN UNSAVOURY CAMPING PLACE</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On entering,” he says, “we raised a considerable amount of
dust and general astonishment; for wishing to pitch our tent
inside the village, we set a few of our men to sweep away the
filth from the cleanest spot we could select. You may guess
the result. I first tried to get to the windward of the horrible
cloud, but not being able to find that desirable quarter, as there
happened to be no wind at the time, I sent a man to fetch
water and then ran away until the atmosphere cleared. I had
better have stopped, for, running through the first hole in the
entrenchment of the village, I heard a cry of ‘<em>Omby ó!</em>’ (‘The
cattle!’), and saw the head of an ox, closely followed by his
tail, coming through the gap. As the people evidently expected
to see me run, I stood my ground with true British
pig-headedness and waited in the narrow ditch for the big
beast to pass; but this one was closely followed by another,
and that by a third—the whole of the herds were coming in
for the night, and the fosse was soon as full of oxen as of
dust. There was no escape; grunting, puffing, blowing,
and bellowing, in they came, and with nothing but bare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
hands to smack them, I was hustled and jostled, bumped and
butted, pushed and driven about, until, after three-quarters
of an hour, I came out in company with the last calf, choked
with dust, streaming with perspiration, and inwardly vowing
that the very next time I heard the cry of ‘<em>Omby ó!</em>’ I would
run for it, however undignified it might appear.”</p>
</div>

<p>As we were walking about just before sunset, they brought
us a chameleon, here called <em>taròndro</em> (<i>Dicranosaura bifurca</i>),
about nine inches long and as much more in length of tail; it
was dark brownish-grey in colour, with a white line along the
sides, and the head and back serrated like a saw. The nose of
the male has two compressed long horns covered with large
scales. As we have already seen, Madagascar contains a considerable
number of these reptiles, especially of species with
remarkable processes on the head.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN UNCOMFORTABLE NIGHT</div>

<p>After arranging for the night, we congratulated ourselves on
our comfortable lodgings, but there was a drawback in the
number of openings to the outer air, two doorways and three
windows, but all destitute of doors or shutters. Mats, rugs,
waterproof sheeting and pillows were, however, fixed up; but
soon after the wind rose until it blew quite a gale; it was like
being in a ship at sea, and it blew so violently as to tear away
the coverings from the nails. For an hour or two paterfamilias’
chief occupation was to go round the place and fix nail after nail,
until I think at least a hundred long tin tacks, as well as a
number of two-inch nails, had been driven in, besides propping
up palanquins against the openings. Often it came in such
tremendous gusts that I feared everything would be torn
away, and lay for some time apprehensive of what might
happen next. However, it moderated towards morning, and,
happily, there were no mosquitoes.</p>

<p>We had not got far on our way the following day before
making acquaintance with the <em>mòkafòhy</em>, an insect about half
the size of a housefly, but with wings less divergent. They
have a large proboscis and give a distinct prick, sometimes
drawing blood, and with after-irritating effects like mosquito
bites. They are more sluggish than mosquitoes and so can be
more easily killed, and with a small whisk of leaves it is not
very difficult to ward them off. The road was still along a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
valley with precipitous hills on our left, and perpendicular faces
of rock. All along were clumps of adàbo-trees, making the
scenery much like an English park. We noticed a large number
of earthen mounds, often two and a half feet high; these were
the nests of a large ant, which, like those we met on the eastern
side of the island, is said to kill a serpent which makes its home
in the lower part of the ant-hill. The native travellers often
use these mounds as a fireplace for cooking their rice, by knocking
off the top, scooping out the centre, and making a hole near
the bottom for draught.</p>

<p>The route continued to be very easy travelling, with gentle
ascents and one long one, following generally river valleys; and
in the afternoon along a river bank for some distance, with
pretty scenery of pandanus, adàbo, dracæna and other trees
growing in clumps. This last-named tree, called <em>hàsina</em> by the
Malagasy, is believed to be a favourite with the Vazìmba, the
supposed aboriginal inhabitants of the island, and was consequently
planted where their graves are and where their spirits
are thought to dwell in order to secure their good will. The
leaves, which are sword-shaped, grow in large clusters, so that
the tree makes a beautiful variety amongst other foliage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DESERT</div>

<p>We stopped on Wednesday night at a large village called
Màngasoàvina, and the next morning passed along the eastern
base of Andrìba, a lofty and very peculiarly shaped mountain,
which had been prominent before us during the preceding day.
It appeared to have a large flat top, and in outline resembled
the stump of an immense tree left in the earth, its northern face
being a stupendous perpendicular mass of rock. (Here I may
remark, in parenthesis, that this Andrìba was expected, in the
French war of 1895, to have presented the most formidable
obstacle to the advance of an invading force and, in the hands
of European troops, would certainly have done so.) In the
afternoon we entered on the part called in Malagasy, <em>èfitra</em>, or
desert, but which simply means an uninhabited region, and
seemed to promise to be the most pleasant part of the whole
route. A long deep gorge which we entered was beautiful with
luxuriant vegetation, and in one of the lateral valleys I soon
perceived the traveller’s tree, a sure sign that we were now from
two thousand to three thousand feet lower than Imèrina.
Every hollow was filled with trees; the hills became lower, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
the vegetation more distinctly tropical, with graceful palms
and other trees common on the eastern coast; as well as species
of ficus, ròtra (<i>Eugenia sp.</i>), hibiscus, tamarind and <em>rofìa</em>
palms; and the mango, escaped from cultivation, often attains
the dimensions of a very large tree.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A PICTURESQUE SCENE</div>

<p>Early on Thursday afternoon we came down to a river, called
Màrokalòy, where our bearers wished us to encamp, but we
feared both mosquitoes and consequent malaria in such a
situation, and ascended a low hill about a hundred and fifty feet
above the river. Here we pitched our tents, and after arranging
for the night sat down to our evening meal round a mat in the
bright moonlight. It was a very picturesque scene: the
brilliant moon and the four chief planets shining resplendently;
our group of men near the tents lighted up by the ruddy glare
of the cooking fires; while down below, the greater body of our
men had encamped and had a score or two of fires blazing under
the dark shade of fine large trees. The night was so warm
that there was no inconvenience sitting out of doors, while in
the tents it soon grew so hot that we were glad to keep out of
them as long as possible. But what surprised us most was the
almost entire absence of mosquitoes; for there was no garden
in Imèrina where one could sit for five minutes at such an hour
without being soon informed of the presence of these tiny pests.
It must, however, be added that for an hour or two before sunset,
and for a little after it also, the <em>mòkafòhy</em> were extremely
numerous and annoying. They persecuted us incessantly while
encamping, but happily, unlike their namesakes,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> they retire
at dark. By a merciful dispensation of providence they do
not bite at night. After our <em>al fresco</em> meal, Mr Street and I
descended to the river and enjoyed a delicious bathe.</p>

<p>The following morning we were up early, but the <em>mòkafòhy</em>
were up before us and made it a misery to do anything
immediately we emerged from the tent. Getting breakfast was
therefore disposed of in a very short space of time, for mouth,
nostrils, and eyes got full of these detestable little flies; one
could not eat, and we hurried the children into their palanquins
and got off as fast as was possible. The name of this pretty
valley (Màrokalòy = “Many <em>alòy</em>”) ought to have warned us,
as <em>alòy</em> is the proper name of the insect, and this place seems to
be their head-quarters. The scenery and the route continued to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
be as pleasant and as easy as before; every hollow was filled
with vegetation of a tropical character, and streams of bright
water crossed our path every few hundred yards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ABUNDANT BIRD LIFE</div>

<p>Bird life seems much more abundant on this western side of
the island than on the east. Black parrots exist in great
numbers and may be heard screeching all the day long. But
perhaps the birds which are more numerous still are the small
green and white parakeet (<em>Sàrivàzo</em>), which fly about from
tree to tree in large flocks, all ceaselessly chirping during their
rapid flight. My friend, Mr Baron, says: “A flock of them
settling on a bare tree gives it the appearance of being covered
with foliage. On one or two occasions what we thought were
the leaves of trees suddenly disappeared, leaving the branches
entirely bare. The ‘leaves’ turned out to be parakeets.”
Guinea-fowl, in flocks of six to a dozen, are also abundant. The
handsome long-tailed green <em>Tsìkirìoka</em> (the Madagascar bee-eater)
is found here, and builds its nest in holes in sand-banks;
some of these run in a horizontal direction for above a yard. A
very pretty hoopoe (<em>Tàkodàra</em>) may occasionally be seen, a bird
which is extremely active and graceful in its movements. It
gives forth five or six very weird notes, as it sits on a tree during
the night. A species of sand-grouse, called <em>Gàdragàdraka</em>, a
bird of a beautiful fawn-colour, much like a pigeon in general
appearance, may often be heard. Like many other native bird
names, this name is very expressive of its chuckling. Many of
the birds found in the central parts of the island exist also here,
while there are also others peculiar to this western region.</p>

<p>Part of our fifth and the whole of our sixth and last day’s
land journey was taken at no great distance from the Ikòpa
river; and I began to wonder where the western forest-belt
was; for, as we have seen, we had passed through no such
masses of dense forest as must be crossed anywhere on the
eastern side of the island when one comes up to the interior of
Madagascar. The fact seems to be that there is no such continuous
wooded region on the western side. There is, in many
places, a considerable amount of country covered with forest,
but these are not connected, and a great deal of the surface has
scattered clumps of trees. In the same way also, there are
nothing like the difficult ascents and deep gorges to be crossed
on this route such as are described in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapters IV.</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_V">V.</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
descent to the level western plains is gradual; so that a railway
to the north-west ports, along the valleys of the Ikòpa and
Bétsibòka rivers, would, although longer, present very much
less engineering difficulty than that from Tamatave to the
capital.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DIFFICULT PROBLEM</div>

<p>On Saturday morning we came to the bank of the Ikòpa,
which river is at some points half-a-mile or more wide, but then
at its lowest level, being apparently very shallow, but so interrupted
everywhere with shelves of rock that it would be
difficult for even a small canoe to make its way far. There
were numerous islands, covered with bamboo, bàraràta, <em>rofìa</em>-palms
and other vegetation. From a low hill we had a view
over an immense expanse of flat country on the western side
of the river. Only here and there was the level broken by a
line of hills of small elevation. After leaving the Ikòpa we
found ourselves in a very different kind of country from any
we had yet passed through, a succession of low hills or mamelons
of dry sandy gravel, with hardly any vegetation, and looking
as if no rain had fallen upon it for years. In the afternoon I
noticed that a large number of granite boulders were strewn
over the country, and could hardly doubt that these, from their
rounded forms, but especially from the absence, as far as I
could see, of any such rock <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i>, must by some means or
other have been transported from the granitic region of the
interior far to the eastward. Must this not have been glacier
or iceberg action? Although it is difficult to understand such
agency in the tropics.</p>

<p>Ten years after making the journey, my friend, Mr Baron, in
travelling across the island towards the north-west coast, but
about a hundred and twenty miles farther north, came across
isolated rocks, which were quite different in composition from
anything near them. Of these he said: “I could think of no
agent to account for their occurrence but that of glacial action.
They seemed to me to be perched blocks, as there was no hill
near from which they could have fallen, nor any rock of the kind
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i>.” I was interested to find that an expert in Madagascar
geology like Mr Baron had come to the same conclusion as
myself with regard to these granite boulders.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon we arrived at Mèvatanàna, the most
important place in this part of the country, with about a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
houses; it had, however, been quite recently burnt down,
but was in process of rebuilding. The houses seemed rather
larger than those in Imèrina, made of round-pole framework,
filled in with <em>bàraràta</em> stems, the roofs of <em>rofìa</em>-palm leaf-stalks
and thatched with grass. We secured a new house, not quite
finished; and as this was very like a large birdcage, besides
having no doors in the three doorways, we put up the tent on
one side, piled up our heavy luggage against another of the
doorways, and hung a rug over the third, so as to make
ourselves less of a public spectacle.</p>

<p>We were glad of the Sunday’s rest after our week of continuous
travelling, and that we had <em>not</em> “to shift our moving tent”
that morning, but could let beds and baggage, boxes and bottles,
and pots and pans rest in peace. We had large and attentive
congregations in the native church morning and afternoon,
Mr Briggs and I taking the services. Our dwelling, although
perfect as regards ventilation, was certainly not cool, and we all
were suffering somewhat from the mosquito bites on the
journey. We were as much stared at by the “natives” as
if we had been a kind of wild animal, a wondering, if not admiring,
crowd unpleasantly blocking up the one doorway left open—in
fact, we formed an apparently popular exhibition, open,
Sundays not excepted, for a limited period only.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OUR CANOES</div>

<p>We were astir very early on the Monday morning, for there
was a large amount of work to be got through before we could
start on our canoe voyage. We got away from the town before
seven, and half-an-hour’s ride brought us down to the river,
where we found six large canoes, four of which were being
loaded with our luggage. When everything had been arranged,
we had to pay all our men, only about ten going through with
us to Mojangà; and a few others had to be engaged in addition
to row the canoes and help in various ways. About nine
o’clock we got away and began our four days’ voyage down
the Ikòpa. It was a pleasant change from the jolting of the
palanquin to the smooth gliding of the canoe. These vessels
were about forty feet long; and the one in which we went was
three feet six inches beam, and two feet six inches deep, and
had three paddlers, besides one at the stern to steer; as we
were going down with the current, more men were not necessary.
Two of the palanquins with their hoods were placed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
in our canoe, for wife, nurse and little girls, while the little
boys, in their palanquin, went in another one with Mr Street
and Mr Briggs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CROCODILES</div>

<p>The shores of the river are exceedingly pretty, although there
was nothing grand or striking. They are flat, but beautifully
wooded, the great <em>bàraràta</em> grass, with its light grey feathery
head of flowers, giving quite a character to the scenery. Islands
are numerous, some being mere sand-banks, but many covered
with trees and bush. We soon made acquaintance with the
crocodiles, for there was one basking in the sunshine on a sand-bank
just opposite our starting-place. We saw a good many
of them during the day, although not as many as other travellers
have observed, perhaps from twenty to thirty, and some of
them quite near enough to be seen very distinctly. Most of
them were light grey in colour, but others slaty, and others
again spotted with black; they varied in length from seven
or eight to fourteen or fifteen feet. The head is small, and the
back and tail serrated like a great pit-saw. They were generally
lying with the jaws wide open, and sometimes were near
enough to be splashed by the paddles as we passed them. The
heat on the river was much less than when travelling on the
land, or at Mèvatanàna; a delightful breeze blew against us all
day, and we enjoyed the change immensely.</p>

<p>The banks of the river, which was from half to three-quarters
of a mile wide, were only a few feet above the water, and from
them flew numbers of birds. Among these were many with
which we were familiar in the interior—the pure white
lesser egret, varieties of heron, purple kingfishers, wild ducks
and wild geese, and many others. The <em>Railòvy</em> or fork-tailed
shrike is one of the most widely distributed birds of the island,
and is very active and an excellent singer. Perched on a dead
branch, it keeps up a constant noise, its strong voice giving
forth several notes, which very much resemble that of an organ.
In the spots frequented by a large number of these shrikes,
each one reserves to itself a hunting-ground, in which according
to M. Pollen, he tolerates the presence of no other birds, even
of his own kind, not excepting those stronger than himself.
It is dark bluish-green in colour, with a long tail, forked at the
extremity. These western woods are fairly full of singing
birds, especially in the hot season, which was coming on at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
time of our journey. Among these are three species of fly-catcher,
one of which is called the “changeable,” from the
remarkable changes of colour it undergoes according to its age
and sex. The female bird is entirely of reddish-brown, except
the cap and nape, which are dark green. The young male has
during the first month the same livery as the female, but its
plumage soon changes to a beautiful maroon red; then very
soon the two middle tail feathers become greatly lengthened,
the quills being black with a white fringe; the wing coverts
become partly black and partly white; and the feathers of the
head change to dark green, with brilliant metallic reflections.
At the breeding-time the back and throat take the same tints
as the head, and the belly and breast become white.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TAMARIND-TREES</div>

<p>We stopped for lunch at a low rising ground, a few feet above
the water, at a grove of <em>Madìro</em> or tamarind-trees, and under
one of these we spread our meal. It was a magnificent tree,
shapely and rounded in outline like a great oak or chestnut,
the branches spreading over a circle of a hundred feet in diameter
and touching the ground. The foliage was then rather
thin, the leaves being minute, like those of a mimosa, and the
ground was strewed with them, as well as with the pods of the
fruit. Most of these were dry and worthless, but we got many
fresh enough to eat, and their acid dark red pulp was very
refreshing. Mr Baron believes the tamarind-tree to be truly
indigenous to Madagascar, but only in the western region,
which he thinks forms its original home. The seeds were, and
probably still are, employed in the <em>sikìdy</em>, or divination; and a
decoction from the leaves as a medicine.</p>

<p>About an hour after leaving our stopping-place we came to the
junction with the Bétsibòka, the latter being strongly coloured
with red clay from North Imèrina. What impressed us most
this afternoon was the total absence of population on the banks
of this large river, and it appeared strange that immense tracts
of such apparently fertile country should be uninhabited; it
was different from the crowded villages along the Màtitànana
and Mànanàra and other rivers in South-east Madagascar.
In the afternoon the beautiful fan-palm became very plentiful,
growing in extensive groves and mingled with the other
trees. Stopping for the night by a sand-bank, we made
the canoe fast to a stake and proceeded to put up the tents.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
Although dry and pleasant for a floor, the sand had the disadvantage
of giving bad holding-ground for the tent-pegs, and,
had not the fresh breeze died away at sunset, a very slight
gust would have brought down the whole concern over our
heads.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE AGY-TREE</div>

<p>We might congratulate ourselves in not coming across, in
short rambles among the trees, a tree which caused no small
discomfort to some of our missionary friends in this very
locality. Mr Montgomery thus describes his experiences. He
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Walking under some trees and pushing aside the reeds and
grass, I was startled, in a moment, by a sudden tingling and
pricking sensation over the back of my hands and fingers, for
never had come the like to me, in Madagascar or elsewhere. I
stopped in sudden surprise, for the pain was severe, and I had
touched nothing except the grass. But in another moment
the pain increased, the tingling burning sensation seemed extending
rapidly up my wrists, and I could see nothing to cause
it. But as I lowered my head to look, pain, scalding pain, shot
into my ears and neck, growing worse, too, every instant.
Dazed and bewildered, I stood a few seconds in helplessness, for
I could neither see nor guess at the cause of the terrible distress.
Then I got back to my company with agony writ plain enough
on every line of my face.</p>

<p>“The men started up when they saw me, some of them crying
out, ‘You have been stung by the agy.’ Some of them led me
to a seat, others rushed for water from the river, and two or
three brought sand heaped up in their hands. Then they
chafed me with the sand and water to take out the stinging
hairs, which they knew caused the mischief. As they rubbed
me, I felt the pain abate, and after about a quarter of an hour’s
continuance of the operation I was comparatively free from
pain. While the men were rubbing me, I was able to discern to
some extent the cause of my distress. Countless hairs, like tiny
arrows, almost transparent, pointed at either end, and from a
third to a fourth of an inch long, had dropped down on me in an
invisible shower from the agy-tree, as I passed and stood under
it. Ere I came away that afternoon, very cautiously I ventured
to examine the tree at a little distance, and found that these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
tiny hairs grew outside a thickish pod or shell, not quite so
large as a small banana. These pods were fully ripe (unluckily
for me) just at that very time, and the light wind was scattering
their covering.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr Baron says that the agy is <i>Mucuna axillaris</i>; it is not,
however, “a tree,” but a climbing plant, and had grown over
the tree under which Mr Montgomery happened to pass. He
had himself a similar experience on his way to Mojangà, and
the sensation “reminded him of the sting of a nettle, but was
ten times more virulent.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A PERPETUAL DELIGHT</div>

<p>Our second day’s canoe voyage brought us into a part of the
river, with many windings among park-like glades of trees.
Then the lovely fan-palms became very numerous; at times
we passed closer to the banks, a tangled mass of <em>bàraràta</em> bending
down into the river, and the tall grey columns of the palms
standing up sometimes from the very edge of the water, with
their graceful crown of green fans sharply defined against the
blue of the sky. Everything seemed to be steeped in light and
heat. Surely of all the millions of beautiful things in this
beautiful world, palms are among the most lovely, and the fan-palm
not least among this glorious family of trees. It was a
perpetual delight to the eye to watch them as we swept rapidly
by the banks with the strong current, as one by one they passed
by as in a panorama. But for mosquitoes, certainly parts of the
tropics are earthly Edens. These palms are called <em>Sàtranabé</em>,
and are much used by the western peoples in building their huts.
A smaller species, called <em>Sàtramira</em>, is also employed in manufacturing
mats and baskets. Both are species of <i>Hyphæne</i>.</p>

<p>But beautiful objects were not the only ones prominent in
this journey, and the presence of the scaly reptiles we saw every
few minutes was not altogether in harmony with the graceful
palms. They seemed, indeed, to be somewhat out of place,
“survivals,” as indeed they are, of an earlier age of the world
when gigantic saurians—creeping, walking, swimming and
flying—were the ruling existences, in a world of slime and mud
and ooze, and not in accord with these beautiful trees, which
seem as if they should rather be associated with bright-coloured
birds and insects than with these crawling saw-backed monsters.
Beautiful birds were not wanting, however, in the scene, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
we came across a flight of lovely little sun-birds, with bright
metallic plumage, which glittered in the sunshine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRUIT-BATS</div>

<p>Birds are not the only flying creatures to be seen in this
western region; although I was not so fortunate as to see them,
Mr Grainge, in travelling down this river in the preceding year
speaks of seeing great numbers of fruit-bats (<i>Pteropus edwardsii</i>).
Their flight is slow, and broken at each moment by strokes of the
wings; and those he saw flew so straight and steadily that he
took them at first, in the doubtful evening light, for benighted
crows. He also remarks that they were always flying in a
direct line <em>from</em> the setting sun. One that he shot measured
more than four feet across the wings. M. Pollen says that they
may be seen sometimes in broad daylight, flying from one
forest to another, when one might take them for crows. He
also remarks: “I have observed these animals fly like swallows
over a lake, just skimming the surface of the water with their
wings. They choose isolated places, especially the little
wooded islands at some distance from the coast.”</p>

<p>Madagascar is the home of one or two other species of fruit-bat,
two species of the horseshoe-bats (<i>Rhinolo-phidæ</i>), seven species
of the <i>Vespertilionidæ</i> or true bats, and three species of the
<i>Emballonuridæ</i> or thick-legged bats; no doubt there are still
many species undescribed, and until much more minute investigation
is made of the fauna of the island, the crepuscular and
nocturnal habits of these animals will always make it difficult
to learn much about their peculiarities.</p>

<p>The morning’s voyage brought us in several places along low
sections of stratified sandstone rock, looking like ruined walls,
some courses being deeply honeycombed by the action of the
water, while others, of harder material, were smooth, like newly
laid masonry. It was clear that we had left behind us, in the
upper highland, the crystalline rocks, the granites and gneisses
and the like, and were in a region of Secondary strata, like the
oolites of our own country. Subsequent examination by many
observers has confirmed this fact, and shown that an extensive
series of Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks occupies a great portion
of the western low land, from north to south of the island.
These plains must have formerly been a portion of a wider
Mozambique Channel than now exists to separate Madagascar
from Africa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>In certain shales which occur among the Secondary strata of
the western plains, Belemnites are so numerous that the Sàkalàva
used them as rifle balls; while many species of ammonites
are formed, some being a foot in diameter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SÀKALÀVA</div>

<p>As we proceeded, the country became more hilly and with
more extensive woods; but as for population, not a soul did we
see, except two women at one spot, and again we asked, where
are the people? And here a few words may be said about the
inhabitants of this part of the country. Along about two-thirds
of the western side of Madagascar, the people are loosely
called Sàkalàva; but every district has its people with its own
tribal name, for “Sàkalàva” was originally the name of one
particular tribe, which, through European or Arab admixture
and the possession of fire-arms, conquered the other tribes and
founded two kingdoms, Ibòina to the north, and Mènabé to the
south. These Sàkalàva kingdoms were the dominant ones in
the island until the beginning of the nineteenth century, when
the Hovas gradually obtained the leadership. Physically,
these people are taller and stronger than the Hovas, are darker
in colour, less civilised, and have an African strain in them,
from their proximity to the continent. Still, they are not of
African stock, but are no doubt, Melanesian in origin. Their
language presents a good deal of difference from the Hova form
of Malagasy, both in vocabulary and in pronunciation, yet the
groundwork and the grammar is essentially the same. They
are more nomadic in habit than the Hovas, breaking up their
villages at the death of any of its inhabitants, and not cultivating
rice like most Malagasy tribes, but subsisting largely on manioc
root, bananas, fish and vegetables.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN OFFENSIVE TREE</div>

<p>We stopped to lunch under a fine adàbo-tree; all along the
main branches of this tree, the small fig-like fruits were clustered
by hundreds, most of them being ripe and scarlet in colour.
During an afternoon’s voyage the river became narrower, but
with a deep and strong current. We lost the fan-palms, but
passed for some miles along a beautifully wooded portion of
country, with fine large trees, like those in an English park, and
growing close to the water’s edge. One of these beautiful trees,
however, has a very vile odour when cut up for timber, so that
although the wood is good for carpentry, when new it is in the
highest degree offensive. It is called <em>Komàngo</em>, and the people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
say that its smell, as a tree, is so strong that birds settling on its
branches die immediately. A high price is given for chips or
twigs of the tree, to be used as charms, for few are daring
enough to cut it down.</p>

<span class="fs70">TO THE NORTH-WEST COAST</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">CROCODILES are not the only reptiles to be seen in
the river, for we also saw many large tortoises. They
were chiefly of the genus <i>Pyxis</i>, the Geometric or
Box tortoise, having the carapace divided into large hexagons
beautifully marked, and were basking in the sun on small spits
of sand rising just above the surface of the water. A carapace
which I afterwards procured on the coast was about eighteen
inches long. Two other species are also found in Madagascar,
named respectively, <i>Testudo geometria</i> and <i>Testudo radiata</i>.</p>

<p>In former times the lakes and marshes of the island were inhabited
by an immense species of tortoise, whose remains have
been found together with those of the gigantic birds (Æpyornis),
the hippopotamus and the great extinct lemurs, all of which
were no doubt contemporaneous, lasting until the arrival of man
on the scene. But although extinct on the mainland of Madagascar,
they seem to have survived on the Mascarene group of
Mauritius, Réunion and Rodriguez until a very recent date,
and they are still living in the little island of Aldabra, which is
about two hundred and sixty miles north-west of Cape Ambro.
There are two living examples of these huge creatures in the
Regent’s Park Gardens. The male tortoise, which is much the
larger of the two, is five feet five inches in length, and five feet
nine inches in breadth, broader, in fact, than it is long. It
weighs about eight hundred pounds, and is believed to be able
to carry a ton weight on its back. It is now at least a hundred
and fifty years old, but is still young and is likely to grow to a
much greater size. From the geometric-shaped plates of its
carapace, it seems to be allied to the geometric tortoise, still
plentiful in Madagascar, as we have just seen. Until lately, it
was supposed that these great tortoises were becoming extinct
on Aldabra, but by the most recent accounts of the island, it
appears that this is not likely to be the case, the dense jungle of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
pandanus giving them ample protection, as it is at night when
they leave this shelter, and go in search of food.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Although we saw no villages during this day’s voyage, there
was evidence of some population, in people fishing along the
river bank, canoes moored by the shore, and women drawing
water, carefully avoiding going into the stream, and filling
their vessels with a small gourd fastened to a long bamboo.
The scenery also was more varied, there being lines of low hills,
partly covered with wood, and the banks of the river lined with
large trees.</p>

<p>Our third day’s voyage took us again along a very beautiful
extent of park-like scenery. All yesterday afternoon we were
gradually approaching a long line of blue hills running north-north-west
and south-south-east, and this morning we got
nearer to them. They appeared to be about a thousand feet
high, and almost covered with dense forest, with patches of
rock and red clay showing here and there. Landing at noon
for lunch among magnificent trees, I noticed that these were
swarming with ants, which covered the trunks and devoured
every fruit as soon as it became ripe.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">A FIERCE ANIMAL</div>

<p>During this journey to the north-west, we saw no mammals
except herds of oxen; but as there <em>are</em> a few others, it will be
fitting here to say something about the largest carnivorous
animal found in the island, especially as this district is its
special habitat. This creature is called by the people, <em>Fòsa</em>
(<i>Cryptoprocta ferox</i>), and although small is very ferocious, as its
specific name denotes. The fòsa differs from most of the
felidæ by the greater elongation of the body, including the
head, and it is plantigrade, like the bears, and not digitigrade,
like the majority of the cats. In its structure it resembles the
jaguar, and in its colouring the puma, indeed it is very like a
small jaguar, as it has thick glossy fur of a tawny-brown, which
becomes somewhat darker under the body. Its total length
is four feet eight inches, but of this the tail occupies two feet
two inches, and it stands about one foot three inches high. For
its size, the animal is powerful, but it is not dangerous to man,
except when it is wounded, or at the breeding season. It is
destructive to poultry and small animals, and it is able to emit
a very fetid odour from an anal pouch, with which fowls are
said to be killed. Examples of the fòsa have been seen in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
outskirts of the upper belt of forest on the east side of the island;
and of somewhat larger size than the dimensions already given.
A specimen I once saw was of a beautiful black colour, but I
believe this was only a variety, and not a distinct species from
the brown animal. The fòsa is much dreaded by the Malagasy,
and, from its mode of attack, appears to be like an immense
weasel, attacking large animals, such as the wild boar and even
oxen. Like the aye-aye among the quadrumana, and many
of the native birds, the fòsa has no near relative, and therefore
a new family had to be formed for it, of which it is the only genus
and species.</p>

<p>The other carnivora of Madagascar are all small animals, and
are rarely seen except when trapped. They all belong to the
viverridæ or civets, two to the civets proper, five (or six) being
mungooses, and one, an ichneumon. The mungooses, known
to the Malagasy under the name of <em>Vontsìra</em>, somewhat resemble
the weasels and ferrets of Europe, except that they are not
exclusively flesh feeders. They feed upon poultry, rats and
mice, and also fruits. The ichneumon, or <em>Fanàloka</em>, is about
twenty inches long, with a bushy tail of about a third that
length, and is covered with thick warm brown fur. Its claws
are long and are used to dig up the eggs of the crocodile, on
which it is said to feed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COLOURED FISH</div>

<p>Although we saw an occasional angler on the banks of the
river, we were not fortunate enough to see any of the fish.
According to M. Pollen, the rivers of the north-west contain a
number of fish, many of which are coloured in a most striking
manner; the plates of his valuable work on the fauna of the
island show these as banded and barred with the most vivid
colours—blue, scarlet, black and yellow—in fact, very much
like those strikingly coloured and curiously marked fishes which
inhabit the sea round coral reefs and feed upon the brightly
tinted polyps.</p>

<p>Wednesday afternoon’s voyage was, as regards scenery, the
most beautiful of the whole journey. Instead of the country
becoming flatter as we approach the sea, it increases in boldness
and picturesqueness. Lines of hills covered with wood lie in all
directions, and amongst these the river winds, making sudden
turns almost at right angles, so that we proceeded towards
almost every point of the compass except due south. A few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
scattered hamlets, of three to six huts each, began to appear.
The crocodiles were numerous, from the old patriarch to the
infant of a foot or so long. We must have seen a hundred of
them that afternoon. We had some difficulty in landing and
pitching our tents, and on account of the heat and the mosquitoes
passed the most uncomfortable night of the entire
journey. Hardly anyone was able to sleep, and I was glad to
get up at four o’clock and dress in the bright moonlight and
rouse up the others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OUTRIGGER CANOES</div>

<p>Our fourth (and last) day of canoe voyaging was begun soon
after six o’clock. Outrigger canoes made their appearance, a
style of craft the Hovas seem never to have invented, nor are
such in use on the east coast. The scenery increased in boldness,
with precipitous hillsides rising from the side of the river, which
here was about the size of the Thames at Kew. About an hour
after leaving, we found the current running up the stream; it
was feeling the influence of the tide from the ocean, still many
miles distant. The foliage was most dense and luxuriant, from
the summit of the hills down to the water’s edge, in some parts
the long lianas forming immense festoons and making a perfect
wall of exquisite green, while the ever-present <em>bàraràta</em> shoots
up its feathery head. After some time we turned from the
main stream into a branch river, much narrower, but running
for many miles in a straight line. As the day advanced, the
intense sunlight made everything glow with light and heat,
lighting up the dense vegetation most brilliantly. Groups of
pandanus were frequent here among the more European-like
trees; these are of two species, one rising into a lofty cone, almost
like a low poplar, and the other one more spreading and
brandishing, with the aerial roots rising high above the ground.
After an hour or two we came again into the main stream, here
more than a mile wide, the banks being still thickly wooded.
It was intensely hot, and we were not sorry to see Màrovoày
(“Many crocodiles”) a few miles ahead of us on a detached
hill to the east of the river.</p>

<p>At one o’clock we stopped when opposite the town, the water
approach to it being by a small tidal stream which flows into
the main river some miles farther down. Our men were just
enough to carry the wife and baby and little girl in their palanquin
across the mile or two, while the native nurse and I walked;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
the others, who were some way behind, had to go farther down
the river in the canoes, and consequently had three or four
hours’ paddling in the glowing afternoon sun, which we who
took the land journey avoided.</p>

<p>Màrovoày is situated on the north-east bank of a small river,
which we had to cross by a canoe. Nearly a dozen dhows were
either anchored in the stream or aground on mud-banks, giving
the place the aspect of a small fishing town. The lower town,
with perhaps two hundred houses, was chiefly occupied by Arab
and Indian traders, their stores and warehouses lining the main
street through which we passed. The Hova town and government
compound (<em>ròva</em>) was on a low hill, rising abruptly from
the level to the height of eighty or a hundred feet. Coming up
to the gate of the <em>ròva</em>, we stopped to rest and sent word of our
arrival to the governor. While we were waiting, one of our
men thoughtfully got us a coffee-pot full of <em>rànom-pàry</em> (sugar-cane
juice), and never did nectar taste more delicious than that
as we took repeated “pulls” at it after our walk across the rice-fields
in the glowing sunshine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A WELCOME REST</div>

<p>Presently we were invited to enter, the governor coming out
to meet us, and brought us into his house, a rather smartly
furnished place of one large room, but with a wide gallery all
round it. Here we were glad to rest after our hot voyage and
walk, and enjoyed an excellent cup of coffee, which they kindly
made for us, as well as some of Huntley &amp; Palmer’s “best
mixed biscuits.” We felt as if we were getting back into a
civilised land again! After a little while we moved into the
chapel, which was also within the <em>ròva</em>; this was a large building,
and looked quite gay, from being completely papered with good
wall-paper, but badly laid on, for the native workman evidently
thought that the white edging to each piece was a part of the
pattern, and so had carefully left it visible in every case! The
wooden posts of the roof were all papered too. The pulpit was a
curious example of its kind, being made of lattice-work, gaily
painted, with a number of small looking-glasses let into its
front, and backed by wall-paper. It had a flat canopy or sounding
board and a large door, so it was like a little room of itself.
With its numerous doors and windows there was a beautiful
breeze through the building, and we anticipated a comfortable
night, but, alas! our hopes were not realised, for the heat was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
intense, and the mosquitoes persecuted us by hundreds. This
town is probably one of the hottest in the island, and we were
told that later on, in the rainy season, the place is almost
unbearable from the clouds of these insects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FROM CANOE TO DHOW</div>

<p>Our day at Màrovoày was occupied chiefly in arranging for
leaving for Mojangà the same evening, and in transferring all
our baggage to one of the dhows lying in the river. There is an
extensive view from the upper part of the town, as the country
is very flat for many miles round. In the evening we dined
with the governor and his wife in the <em>làpa</em>, and went down to the
river at about nine o’clock. With some difficulty, in the darkness,
we transferred ourselves and palanquins, etc., from shore
to canoe, and from canoe to dhow, and at last were crowded
together as thick as we could sit and lie on the little deck.
The ship we embarked in was about thirty-five feet long, by
fourteen or fifteen feet beam; the middle portion open to the
keel, but with a little deck forward and another aft. This
small quarter-deck was about ten to twelve feet square, and
when the two large palanquins for the children to sleep in had
been placed on either side, there was not much space left for five
adults to pack together, in fact we had about as much room as
would be found on a good-sized dining-table.</p>

<p>Soon after ten o’clock we got under way, the tide having
begun to ebb for the previous hour or two. There was no wind,
so six men rowed us down the stream, accompanying their
work with the most curious weird-sounding songs, in Arabic, I
suppose (or perhaps Suahili), some of them sounding very comic.
We swept down rapidly with the tide, the trees looking dark
and gloomy in the uncertain light, and presently the moon rose.
After an hour or two we got into the main river, and in a little
time had to cast anchor, as the tide had turned. It was a
strange night, and we did not get much sleep, as we had not
room to turn, so we waited impatiently for the dawn. Dawn,
however, brought with it a cloud of mosquitoes from the low
swampy ground bordering the river, which was thick with
mangroves and rank vegetation. Just at twilight they surrounded
us by thousands; but as soon as the sun rose, they
disappeared, a gentle breeze sprang up, and we set sail. The
river widened as we proceeded, until it became a large estuary,
and gradually opened into the Bay of Bèmbatòka. The breeze<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
freshened as the day advanced, and we sailed at a considerable
speed.</p>

<p>These dhows are first-rate sailers; they carry one large sail,
in shape like a triangle with one corner cut off. But what
struck us as very curious was that when tacking, they did not
run into the wind’s eye as a European ship does, but they turned
the dhow right round before the wind, while shifting the long
boom to the other side of the mast. But they sail very close to
the wind, and seem excellent sea boats. This form of ship is
probably a very ancient one, for vessels very similar in shape
and rig are figured on the Egyptian monuments, and most
likely the “ships of Tarshish” were only rather large dhows.
The largest of these vessels have two masts, the one at the stern
being much smaller than the other, and both have a <em>rake</em> forward,
instead of aft, as in European ships.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOJANGÀ</div>

<p>Our spirits rose with the wind, for there had been many
prophecies at Màrovoày that we might be a long time on the
way, and, in fact, some friends who preceded us by a month or
two were actually three nights on the voyage. But we bounded
over the waves and soon felt a considerable swell. Bèmbatòka
Bay is so wide for a considerable distance that the north-western
shore is only faintly visible, but it narrows again
towards the mouth, and a line of hills running out to the western
point defines its outline very clearly; opposite Mojangà it is
about five miles across. Towards noon they pointed out to us
a projecting headland, some way ahead to the right, and told
us that after rounding that we should see Mojangà. The wind
continued strong, but as it got more and more ahead, we had to
tack repeatedly. At about half-past three o’clock we reached
our destination, casting anchor a quarter of a mile or so from
the beach.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAMELS</div>

<p>Mojangà was a decidedly pretty and picturesque-looking
place from the sea, and a much more civilised-looking town
than any I had previously seen in Madagascar. Instead of rush
and bamboo houses, there was a long line of white flat-topped
buildings of two and three storeys, some having castellated
battlements. A score or two of dhows were at anchor in the
roads, but there was no European vessel in the harbour. Behind
the Arab and Indian town the ground rises gently for two
hundred or three hundred feet, and at the top of this higher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
ground is the <em>ròva</em> and Hova town. Between the two, and to
the north, is a beautiful park-like expanse, thickly studded
with magnificent trees, chiefly mangoes, which here grow to a
great size, as well as baobabs, and clumps of cocoanut-palms
and a few fan-palms. A fort crowns the crest of the hill to
the north; and altogether, we were agreeably surprised with
Mojangà. Just as we had cast anchor, we were surprised to
see several camels brought down to the sea for a bath. They
were imported from Aden some time ago by a French firm, but
had not proved a success, commercially, for Madagascar has
too damp a climate for animals accustomed to the sand and
gravel of the Arabian desert. We had not landed many minutes
before our brother missionary, Mr Pickersgill, then stationed at
Mojangà, came down and gave us a hearty welcome and every
assistance with our baggage, etc. Our little family party
found quarters in the verandah of the house of a Madame Beker,
very near the shore, while the others went to stay with Mr
Pickersgill near the <em>ròva</em>. This house was of coral rock, plastered,
but was so hot that we preferred the verandah, which was
roofed with fan-palm leaves and surrounded with the same
slight materials. We were glad of the quiet and rest we had
there for a week after our two or three weeks’ travelling by
land and river.</p>

<p>The following morning, Sunday, the mail steamer, <i>Packumba</i>,
came in about midday, but left again for Mozambique in the
afternoon. On going on board to see the ship we were to sail
in, we found that her main deck was arranged so as to take a
great number of passengers, the iron plating at the sides all
turning up on hinges to allow a free passage of air. I was glad
to be able to preach to a large congregation in the native church
during the afternoon.</p>

<p>The week at Mojangà passed away rapidly, for we had plenty
to do in rearranging and labelling luggage, disposing of our
palanquins, bedding, and other no longer needful property, and
preparing for our voyage. At this town we found ourselves
in quite a different place and surroundings from what we had
seen everywhere else in Madagascar. We were in the midst of
an Indian and Mohammedan population, the traders here being
mostly Banians and a large proportion of them British subjects.
Hindoo speech, dress, ornament, and customs met us at every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
turn, and also those of the Arabs. The houses are chiefly
built of coral rock, plastered with lime, and roofed with fan-palm
leaves. The door and window openings are made with
flat-pointed and zigzagged arches; and when the rooms are
wide, a line of piers and arches runs down its length, giving a
cool depth of shade quite Eastern in its effect. The doorways
have elaborately carved lintels and posts; these are all done at
Bombay and brought here ready for fitting. There is a little
stone carving also here and there, and Arabic sentences are
carved over the doors in some cases. The men are in Indian
dress, and the women with nose-jewels, silver armlets and
anklets, and the long muslin robe thrown over the head and
wound round the body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARABIC DRESS AND CUSTOMS</div>

<p>Arabic dress and customs were not less prominent in
Mojangà. Close to our lodging was a small mosque, and from
the flat roof we could hear the <em>muezzin</em> calling the faithful to
prayers five times a day in a long sonorous musical cry—before
sunrise, in the forenoon, at noon, at three o’clock, and at
sunset, and could see his form silhouetted against the sky,
making a number of prostrations when the call was finished.
Our stay here was in the month Ramazan, the great fasting-time
of the Mohammedans, when they eat and drink nothing
all day, at least the strictly orthodox do not. They make up
for it, however, at night; and feasting and jollity seemed to be
the general employment. Our house adjoining the main street,
it was extremely noisy until long after midnight. There is no
doubt that the Arabs, and also the Indians, have been settled
at Mojangà, as well as at other places on the north-west coast,
for centuries. As we have seen in <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">Chapter XII.</a>, there was an
Arab colony at some remote period on the south-east coast, but
this was gradually absorbed and lost in the native population
and no longer maintains a separate existence. The north-western
colony, however, being in constant communication
with Suahili land and the Arab element there, has maintained
its individuality, and kept its dress, customs, language, and
religion quite distinct from the Malagasy around it.</p>

<p>Amongst the magnificent mango-trees in the park are many
specimens of the baobab-tree (<i>Adansonia madagascariensis</i>);
one of these must be from seventy to eighty feet in girth. The
trunks of these trees are of enormous size compared with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
small expanse of the branches; and their glossy dark brown
bark, their rapid tapering upwards, and their bareness of
foliage for the greater part of the year, mark them very distinctly
from all others. They are curious in appearance, but
not at all beautiful. The bark is used to make rope, and the
sap is said to be potable and tasteless; the wood, however, is
so soft that it can be pulled away by the fingers.</p>

<p>Many trees affording beautiful and valuable timber are found
in these western woods; among these is one yielding the kind
called by cabinet-makers “zebra-wood,” while ebony is obtained
from one or more of the twenty-two species of <i>Diospyros</i> known
in the island. We have seen the mangrove (<i>Rhizophora mucronata</i>)
on the shores of Bèmbatòka Bay, and this tree is found
at the mouths of almost all the rivers and inlets on the north-western
coast, where it is the most prominent feature in the
extensive swamps, probably also helping to extend the land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FISHING EAGLES</div>

<p>We had no opportunity of seeing the largest of the Madagascar
birds, the <em>Ankoày</em>, or fishing eagle (<i>Haliaetus vociferoides</i>),
although it is found all along the western coast. It is a large
and handsome bird, and is said to keep watch on a tree or cliff
at the edge of the water, swooping down like lightning into the
sea after its finny prey, and being able to arrest instantaneously
its downward flight. M. Grandidier says that a single pair of
these eagles is found in very many of the innumerable small
bays of the north-western coast, and of this they take exclusive
possession, allowing no other eagle to encroach on their own
preserves. They feed principally on fish, catching adroitly
those which appear near the surface. The name of <em>Ankoày</em>
applied to this bird appears to be an imitative one derived from
its cry of <em>hoai, hoai</em>.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether there is another eagle really indigenous
to Madagascar, although a harrier-eagle (<i>Eutriorchis</i>) was once
shot in the Mangòro valley; if this was not a chance immigrant,
it must be extremely rare. This one example was remarkable
for the extreme shortness of its wings, and immoderate length
of tail.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TURTLES</div>

<p>One of the most important occupations of the coast Sàkalàva
is the catching of turtles (<em>fàno</em>). Some of these creatures are
oval in form and very fat and plump, others are much thinner
and flat; of these latter, some are said to attain a length of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
eight or nine feet. In catching them the natives go out to sea
in the early morning, when the turtles come to the surface to
enjoy their morning nap, and at which time the sea is usually
very smooth. A kind of harpoon, about twelve feet long, shod
with a piece of barbed iron is used, and to this a strong rope, a
couple of hundred yards in length, is attached. Great care and
caution has to be used in approaching the sleeping animal, for,
if struck, it dives down immediately, and the fisherman will not
leave go of the rope, but dives down with it, if the water is deep.
The natives seem to be able to stop an extraordinary time under
water. As soon as the turtle is secured, the captors make for
the shore, and all the people gather together to share in the
feast. Nobody must bring anything from a house to the spot,
for the animal must be wrenched open and cut in pieces with
knives belonging to the canoe, it must be cooked in sea-water
in the shell of the turtle itself, and served in scoops or other
vessels from the canoe, or in pieces of turtle-shell. None of the
flesh is allowed to be brought into a house to be cooked or eaten
there. All these and several other precautions are ancestral
customs and must be religiously observed, or the turtles would
disappear.</p>

<p>A curious account is given by the natives of the north-west
coast of a fish which they call <em>Hàmby</em>, whose length is said to be
about that of a man’s arm, and its girth about that of his thigh.
Its dorsal fin, they say, is just like a brush, and it has a liquid
about it, sticky like glue, and when it fastens on to another fish
from below, with this brush on its head, the fish cannot get
away, but is held fast. On account of this peculiarity, the
people use the hàmby to fish with. When they catch one, they
confine it in a light cage, which they fasten in the sea, feeding
it daily with cooked rice or small fish; and when they want to
use it, they tie a long cord round its tail and let it go, following
it in a canoe. When it fastens on a fish they pull it in and
secure the spoil. I wonder whether this fish has any connection
with one found on the east coast, which is called <em>Làdintavìa</em>, and
is said by Mr Connorton to be covered with a kind of slime, so
that when many of them are together, it looks as if they are
floating in a thick lather of soap.</p>

<p>Two or more kinds of oysters are found on this north-west
coast; one of these is called by the people <em>Sàja</em>, which may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
seen covering the rocks in great abundance on the seashore at
low water. It is a small oyster, but excellent in quality.
Another kind, called <em>Téfaka</em>, is only found at some depth below
water. It is a much larger oyster than the sàja, with the
interior of the shell beautifully pearly. It is said to be delicious
in flavour. Quite recently an English company was projected
to exploit these oyster beds for pearls and for the pearly shells
themselves.</p>

<p>Another sea-living creature in Madagascar waters is a species
of octopus called <em>Horìta</em>, which, notwithstanding its repulsive
appearance, is reckoned a delicacy by the coast people, although
Europeans who have tried it pronounce it as tough and gluey
and uneatable, although cooked for a long time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HERONS</div>

<p>The north-west coasts, from the numerous estuaries surrounded
with trees, are particularly favourable for such birds
as the herons, some species of which are regarded as sacred by
the natives, and are consequently less shy than these birds are
in Europe, while others are very wary and most difficult to
approach. In habits and feeding these Madagascar herons are
much like the European and African species, mostly living on
fish, molluscs and crustacea, the larger ones devouring reptiles
and small birds and mammals, while the smaller kinds are
insectivorous. They are often found in companies, including
several different species, settled on the trees overhanging or
near water, and remaining perfectly motionless for a long time.
Some of the herons appear to be very common, as the ashy, the
black-necked, the purple, the white-winged, the garzetta, and
some others, and especially the small white egret, which we
have noticed more than once in these chapters. Fifteen species
of heron are found in Madagascar, three storks, a spoonbill, five
ibises and a flamingo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ISLAND OF NÒSIBÉ</div>

<p>It was a pleasure to us during our week’s stay at Mojangà to
meet with several old acquaintances among the Hova officers
stationed there; anyone coming from their loved Imèrina
always received a warm welcome. On the Saturday of the
week after our arrival there, the <i>Packumba</i> returned from
Africa, and on the following morning we left in her for Aden
and Europe. Steaming northwards, we kept in sight of the
mainland of Madagascar during the next day, and this appeared
bold and mountainous, and very different from the greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
portion of the eastern coast of the island. There were many
islands rising precipitously out of the sea, while ahead of
us the lofty mountains of the island of Nòsibé soon appeared.
These looked exactly like portions of the interior of Madagascar
set down in the midst of the sea; the same red clay soil and
the same markings of valley and ravine as seen all through the
interior plateaux. Two or three very regular volcanic cones,
truncated and showing the craters, were very prominent;
these are parts of that chain of extinct vents of which we have
seen numerous examples in our travelling through other parts
of the country. Besides the main island of Nòsibé, there are
many outlying portions of it, looking like detached islets
dropped into the sea. Some of these are densely wooded from
base to summit. Altogether, as may be seen from a brief
glance at the map, the north-western side of Madagascar is
totally different, with its numerous deep bays and inlets, from
the eastern side, where there is almost a straight line for many
hundreds of miles. The geology of the two sides is very
different, and this has powerfully affected their physical geography.</p>

<p>We stayed several hours at Nòsibé, discharging and receiving
cargo, and it was nearly sunset when we steamed away to the
north-west for Mayotta. For several hours we could still
see the island and the mainland by the glare of the burning
grass on the hillsides; and these, for more than five years
subsequently, were the last glimpses we had of Madagascar.</p>
